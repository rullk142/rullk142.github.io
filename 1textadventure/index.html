            	</p>
            <br>
            <p id="one">What are you going to do?</p>
                <p id="stare">Stare at them lovingly.</p>
                     <p id="notice">The doge notices you and returns a loving blank stare, blessing your day. Try something else!</p>
                <p id="jump">Jumpscare the poor thing.</p>
                    <p id="air">The doge jumps 6 feet into the air and starts to whimper. You’re so mean. Don’t do that again! Try something else!</p>
                <p id="closer">Go closer to them</p>
<!--                         <p id="gaspii">*GASP!*</p>
                        <p id="lostii">Another doge!</p> -->
                    <p id="squat">After slowly taking a few steps towards the doge, you squat down and try to get their attention.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="two">The doge is just within arms reach! What’re you gonna do now?</p>
                <p id="smack">Smack the doge.</p>
                    <p id="heck">WHAT THE HECKERS IS WRONG WITH YOU. I'M CALLING PETA ON YOU!!! Now look what you've done. The precious doge is IN TEARS. HAVE YOU NO SOUL? TRY SOMETHING ELSE!!!
                <p id="wave">Wave hi at the doge.</p>
                    <p id="smiles">The doge smiles at you. Have a blessed day. Aren't you going to do anything else?
                <p id="stretch">Stretch your hand out to the doge and make clicky noises with your tongue.
                    <p id="sniffs">The doge notices you and sniffs your hand!
            <br><br><br>
            <p id="three">This looks like the beginning of something beautiful. What’re you gonna do now?</p>
                <p id="poke">Poke the doge.</p>
                    <p id="fade">The doge’s usually permanent blank expression of happiness has faded as they realize you are not a friend. The doge shakes their head in disappointment. Try petting them instead.</p>
                <p id="pet">Pet the doge.</p>
                    <p id="bliss">The doge’s eyes are closed in bliss as they wag their tail happily. They lick you and seem to really like you!</p>
            <br>
            <p id="four">I think you’ve just found your new best friend. It has been getting pretty lonely at your apartment. Your heart feels like it’s playing hopscotch in your chest, but then you realize that-- Oh…</p>
            <br>
            <p id="fourii">Oh I see… You realize that the doge is wearing a collar and already has a family they belong to. What will you do?</p>
                <p id="return">Return the doge back to their owner.</p>
                    <p id="cry">It was a blessing to have this encounter with this doge, but at the end of the day, you have to do what’s right.</p>
                    <p id="cryii">Once you reach the address and the doge owner opens their door, they jump for joy as their doge runs around happily around them in circles. You wave goodbye and the doge jumps on you one last time and licks your hand. He leaves you with a special goodbye gift.</p>
                    <p id="cryiii">As you are walking back home to your lonely apartment, the tears come uncontrollably out. It’s okay to ugly cry! I’m ugly crying too! It’s okay, you did the right thing!</p>
                <p id="take">Take the collar off, look around you to make sure no one is looking, and chuck it in the trash.</p>
                    <p id="happy">You bring your new best friend home! Where they will never run away or get lost, go hungry or be cold. You take care of this precious doge and you live happily ever after.</p>
