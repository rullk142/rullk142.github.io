                    <p id="notice">The doge notices you and returns a loving blank stare, blessing your day. But soon walks away, leaving you feeling empty inside.</p>
                    <p id="air">The doge jumps 6 feet into the air and whimpers as they run away. You’re so mean. Don’t do that again.</p>

                <p id="pet">Pet the doge.</p>
                    <p id="fade">The doge’s usually permanent blank expression of happiness has slightly faded as it realizes you are not a friend. The doge walks away in disappointment, shaking its head.</p>
                    <p id="bliss">The doge’s eyes are closed in bliss as it wags its tail happily. It licks you and seems to really like you!</p>
