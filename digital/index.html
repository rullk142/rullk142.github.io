                <b>INT. MAX'S HOME - EVENING 1</b>
                <br><br>
                Black screen: Echoing through a house, we hear A BOY BARKING and A DOG YELPING.
                The picture comes up and a raggedy black dog tears down a set of stairs, toward us.
                <br><br>
                MAX, eight years old and wearing a white wolf suit, jumps down the stairs, tumbling toward the camera, growling and chasing the dog. For some reason, Max is holding a fork.
                <br><br>
                He jumps to the bottom of the stairs tucking and rolling, screeching a feral war-cry and follows the dog off-screen.
                <br><br>
                Max chases the dog under the dining room table and closes in. He leaps and grabs the dog, and howling and somersaulting, they wrestle happily together until the screen freezes.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>EXT. SNOW-COVERED SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY</b>
                <br><br>
                Max's legs protrude from a hand-dug opening in a large snow embankment - a remnant of the morning's snowplows.
                <br><br>
                He crawls out and stands over it, surveying his creation. A proud and crooked grin spreads across his face.
                <br><br>
                He runs off toward his house, wanting badly to tell someone
                about it.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>INT./EXT. MAX'S HOME - DAY</b>
                <br><br>
                Max runs up to the window and taps on the glass. Inside is his sister Claire, 14, talking on the phone with great intensity. We see only Max's eyes peering over the window sill.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    MAX
                    <br>
                    (muffled through the glass)
                    <br>
                    Hey Claire! Wanna see something great?
                </p>
                Claire is too involved in her phone call to pay Max any attention.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    CLAIRE
                    <br>
                    Who else was there?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MAX
                    <br>
                    (trying again)
                    <br>
                    It's an igloo.
                    <br><br>
                    CLAIRE
                    <br>
                    And?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MAX
                    <br>
                    I made it.
                </p>
                Claire doesn't respond. Her phone call is very important to her.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    CLAIRE
                    <br>
                    (responding to the intrusion)
                    <br>
                    Yeah, my brother.
                    No, I can't.
                    <br>We're supposed to go to my dad's that weekend.
                    <br><br>
                    MAX
                    <br>
                    The snowplows left some snow across
                    the street... and I dug a hole into
                    it.
                    <br><br>
                    CLAIRE
                    <br>
                    Max, go play with your friends!
                </p>
                Max is crushed. He walks off, dejected.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>INT. IGLOO - DAY</b>
                <br><br>
                Max sits, resting in his igloo, deep in thought. He exits the igloo with a makeshift flag -- a plastic bag tied to a birch twig. He marches over to a nearby wooden fence and barks orders to it.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    MAX
                    <br>
                    You! Go that way! You! Go that way!
                </p>
                The fence isn't responding. Max kicks it.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    MAX
                    <br>
                    (CONT'D)
                    <br>
                    Don't talk to me like that. You're just a fence. Go play with your own fence friends. Now move out!
                </p>
            
                He runs to his fort and carefully secures his flag to the top. He adjusts it two or three times to make it just right. Max is something of a perfectionist.
                <br><br>
                Just then, Max watches as a car pulls into his driveway. Max sees a group of teenage boys and girls get out of the car and lope into his house.
                <br><br>
                Max gets an idea. He jumps into his igloo and scoops up all of his snowballs. He can't carry them all so he hurriedly rolls them out the entrance.
                <br><br>
                He runs across the street to his house, closer to his prey, carefully balancing his ammunition on his coat, kangaroo style. He hides behind the neighbor's low fence.
                <br><br>
                He waits, excitedly, organizing his arsenal while stealthily peering over the fence. He watches the teens while they're inside his house. Meanwhile, he makes more snowballs.
                <br><br>
                The teenagers come outside with Claire. Max holds a snowball, giddy with anticipation. He waits until they're close enough and then jumps up and unleashes his projectiles. His aim isn't so good, but he has the element of surprise on his side. A few snowballs hit the teenagers, and when they see that it's him, they laugh and start throwing snowballs back. The fight is on.
                <br><br>
                As Max is reloading, a large mound of snow is dumped on his back. The boys are close now, on the other side of the fence. Itâ€™s time to retreat. Max bolts. He runs across the street, giddy--the thrill of battle.
                <br><br>
                He gets to his fort just in time and dives inside. He slides into his little cave - nervous and happy. He's safe.
                <br><br>
                But the boys are upon him. Through the fort's entrance, he sees them approach.
                <br><br>
                An arm comes through the side, searching for Max. Max squirms out of the way, his eyes wide with alarm.
                <br><br>
                Then there's a sickening crunch from above. Another crunch. They're on the roof. Max looks up. The ceiling caves in.
                <br><br>
                Max is trapped in a world of cold white.
                <br><br>
                He claws his way out of the top, and we see his face, red, wet with snow and tears. He's cold and humiliated.
                <br><br>
                The two boys see how upset Max is. They pull back, feeling awful. They walk back across the street.
                <br><br>
                A horn honks - everyone is waiting. The boys run back to the car.
                <br><br>
                Max, hurt and shamed, looks for Claire among the teenagers. He finds her. Max and Claire lock eyes. Claire looks worried and feels bad for Max. Max hopes that Claire will come over, to help and comfort him - even to stick up for him.
