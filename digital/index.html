                <b>INT. MAX'S HOME - EVENING 1</b>
                <br><br>
                Black screen: Echoing through a house, we hear A BOY BARKING and A DOG YELPING.
                The picture comes up and a raggedy black dog tears down a set of stairs, toward us.
                <br><br>
                MAX, eight years old and wearing a white wolf suit, jumps down the stairs, tumbling toward the camera, growling and chasing the dog. For some reason, Max is holding a fork.
                <br><br>
                He jumps to the bottom of the stairs tucking and rolling, screeching a feral war-cry and follows the dog off-screen.
                <br><br>
                Max chases the dog under the dining room table and closes in. He leaps and grabs the dog, and howling and somersaulting, they wrestle happily together until the screen freezes.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>EXT. SNOW-COVERED SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY</b>
                <br><br>
                Max's legs protrude from a hand-dug opening in a large snow embankment - a remnant of the morning's snowplows.
                <br><br>
                He crawls out and stands over it, surveying his creation. A proud and crooked grin spreads across his face.
                <br><br>
                He runs off toward his house, wanting badly to tell someone
                about it.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>INT./EXT. MAX'S HOME - DAY</b>
                <br><br>
                Max runs up to the window and taps on the glass. Inside is his sister Claire, 14, talking on the phone with great intensity. We see only Max's eyes peering over the window sill.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    MAX

                    <br>
                    Hey Claire! Wanna see something great?
                </p>
                Claire is too involved in her phone call to pay Max any attention.

                    <br>
                    It's an igloo.

                    I made it.
                </p>
                Claire doesn't respond. Her phone call is very important to her.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">

                    <br>
                    Yeah, my brother.
                    No, I can't.

                    MAX
                    <br>
                    The snowplows left some snow across
                    the street... and I dug a hole into
                    it.
                    <br><br>
                    CLAIRE
                    <br>
                    Max, go play with your friends!
                </p>
                Max is crushed. He walks off, dejected.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>INT. IGLOO - DAY</b>
                <br><br>
                Max sits, resting in his igloo, deep in thought. He exits the igloo with a makeshift flag -- a plastic bag tied to a birch twig. He marches over to a nearby wooden fence and barks orders to it.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    MAX
                    <br>
                    You! Go that way! You! Go that way!
                </p>
                The fence isn't responding. Max kicks it.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    MAX
                    <br>
                    (CONT'D)
                    <br>
                    Don't talk to me like that. You're just a fence. Go play with your own fence friends. Now move out!
                </p>
            
                He runs to his fort and carefully secures his flag to the top. He adjusts it two or three times to make it just right. Max is something of a perfectionist.
                <br><br>
                Just then, Max watches as a car pulls into his driveway. Max sees a group of teenage boys and girls get out of the car and lope into his house.
                <br><br>
                Max gets an idea. He jumps into his igloo and scoops up all of his snowballs. He can't carry them all so he hurriedly rolls them out the entrance.
                <br><br>
                He runs across the street to his house, closer to his prey, carefully balancing his ammunition on his coat, kangaroo style. He hides behind the neighbor's low fence.
                <br><br>
                He waits, excitedly, organizing his arsenal while stealthily peering over the fence. He watches the teens while they're inside his house. Meanwhile, he makes more snowballs.
                <br><br>
                The teenagers come outside with Claire. Max holds a snowball, giddy with anticipation. He waits until they're close enough and then jumps up and unleashes his projectiles. His aim isn't so good, but he has the element of surprise on his side. A few snowballs hit the teenagers, and when they see that it's him, they laugh and start throwing snowballs back. The fight is on.
                <br><br>
                As Max is reloading, a large mound of snow is dumped on his back. The boys are close now, on the other side of the fence. It's time to retreat. Max bolts. He runs across the street, giddy--the thrill of battle.
                <br><br>
                He gets to his fort just in time and dives inside. He slides into his little cave - nervous and happy. He's safe.
                <br><br>
                But the boys are upon him. Through the fort's entrance, he sees them approach.
                <br><br>
                An arm comes through the side, searching for Max. Max squirms out of the way, his eyes wide with alarm.
                <br><br>
                Then there's a sickening crunch from above. Another crunch. They're on the roof. Max looks up. The ceiling caves in.
                <br><br>
                Max is trapped in a world of cold white.
                <br><br>
                He claws his way out of the top, and we see his face, red, wet with snow and tears. He's cold and humiliated.
                <br><br>
                The two boys see how upset Max is. They pull back, feeling awful. They walk back across the street.
                <br><br>
                A horn honks - everyone is waiting. The boys run back to the car.
                <br><br>
                Max, hurt and shamed, looks for Claire among the teenagers. He finds her. Max and Claire lock eyes. Claire looks worried and feels bad for Max. Max hopes that Claire will come over, to help and comfort him - even to stick up for him.
                <br><br>
                But she doesn't. She turns away to talk to someone in the car. The car, with Claire in it, drives away. Shaken and raw, Max runs to the house.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>INT. MAX'S HOME - LATE AFTERNOON (CONTINUOUS)</b>
                <br><br>
                Max enters his house covered in snow, and runs upstairs into Claire's room.
                <br><br>
                Max rips off his hat and gloves and throws them on the floor. He jumps up and down on Claire's bed, dumping snow everywhere. On her dresser, he sees an elaborate valentine that he made her out of popsicle sticks and construction paper. It says <i>"To Claire. Love, Max."</i> He grabs it and tears it to pieces.
                <br><br>
                As he calms down he realizes what he's done. He picks up the pieces of the valentine and walks to his room.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>INT. MAX'S BEDROOM</b>
                <br><br>
                Max lays in bed, silent, worried. On the dresser next to his bed is a globe, an antique, lit from within. Max reads the inscription on a small brass panel on the globe:
                <br><br>
                <i>TO MAX, OWNER OF THIS WORLD. Love, Dad</i>
                <br><br>
                He hears high heels clicking in the kitchen below. Max looks forlorn, wishing he hadn't done what he's done. His mom's footsteps echo through the house, getting closer to the stairs.
                <br>

                We hear her walking upstairs. She enters the room and sees Max under his covers. She sits down on his bed and kisses his head. She's wearing her work clothes - a wool skirt and white cotton blouse.

                    I would have done something about it.
                </p>
                    The guilt overtakes Max.

                    <b>INT. MOM'S OFFICE AREA - NIGHT (LATER)</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Max's mom works at home at night in a room at the rear of the house. Overlooking the backyard, it's a room used for many purposes. Outside, the snow has turned to rain and it's coming down, silver streaks outside the window.
                    <br><br>
                    Mom is typing on her computer, an older model, while talking on the phone to a co-worker. Max enters the room tentatively.
                    <br><br>
                    Feeling a bit guilty about earlier, Max wants to make up with his mom. He fiddles with a few things in the room, circling his mom without overtly asking for attention.
                    <br><br>
                    Mom, still not paying any mind to Max, looks anxious - but more than that, simply tired and worn out. As she continues her phone conversation, we catch only glimpses of her from Max's point of view.
                    <br>
                    <p id="talk">

                        No, I don't want to bother you, just... just quickly can you tell me exactly what Mr. Lasseter didn't like about the report? ...Well what am I suppose to do? No, I'm just tired and there's been some stuff here at home.... So what can I do to fix this?
                    </p>
                    Max, trying to make her smile, adopts the posture of a robot.
                    <br><br>
                    She looks over to him. He continues walking robot-style and turns his head to smile at her, not noticing he's about to walk into the wall. He falls down, to comic effect. His mom buries a laugh and puts her finger to her lips, telling Max to shush. Max grins. Success.

                    </p>
                    He plops himself on the floor under her desk and looks at his mom's feet. She's taken off her shoes, but is still wearing her tights; Max tugs gently on the tights over her right toe.

                        Okay, there were some buildings... There were these really tall buildings...and they could walk. Then there were some vampires. One of the vampires bit the tallest building and his fangs broke off...then all his other teeth fell out...then he started crying...and then all the other vampires said Why are you crying? Aren't those just your baby teeth? And he said, No, those are my grownup teeth...and the vampires knew that he couldn't be a vampire anymore, so they left him.

                    The classroom is a familiar one Formica furniture and a chalkboard, large windows. The branches of nearby trees touch the glass when the wind surges. Max's teacher, male, is short and thin, bearded and wearing a cardigan.

                        ... the sun is the center of our solar system. It's the reason all the planets are here. Its warmth gives us sunlight, makes our planet liveable. Of course the sun won't always be here to keep us warm. It, like all things, will die... and when it does, first it'll expand, enveloping all the surrounding planets, including Earth, before consuming them rapidly.<br>

                        The sun, after all, is just fuel burning ferociously... and when it runs out of fuel... well... it'll be gone. Well after that, the solar system will go dark... permanently.

                    </p>
                    Max looks at everyone. His mom, the
                    boyfriend...

                    </p>
                    This is the last straw with Max. He turns red
                    with rage and runs out of the house, into the
                    night. His mom runs out the door after him.

                    She follows him for a block, but quickly loses
                    ground.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max cuts across yards and down an
                    embankment. Now he's free. He runs toward
                    the forest in the distance, where the road
                    ends and the trees begin.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>EXT. NEARBY FOREST - NIGHT</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Max, still high from the run and still breathing
                    hard, comes into the forest.<br>
                    <br>
                    He reaches a small clearing around a fallen
                    tree, where he has a few possessions stashed.
                    Max grabs a large stick and stomps around,
                    hitting things violently.
                    <br><br>
                    The wind blows louder, whipping the leaves
                    around in a fury. Max, feeling the night's
                    power, howls into the sky.<br>
                    <br>
                    He finds himself at the shore. The stars are
                    out and themoon is reflected on the placid
                    water.<br>
                    <br>
                    A boat floats. Max looks around to see
                    if anyone is there. The boat isn't tied to
                    anything, and starts to drift away. Max rushes
                    toward it and grabs the loose rope attached
                    to it. He pulls the boat back slowly. He looks
                    around again, wondering if the boat has an
                    owner, if anyone's watching. He stands
                    before the boat, the trees swaying violently
                    around him.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max steps into the boat. The vessel slowly
                    drifts away.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max allows the boat to drift, watching
                    seriously and intentionally as the land grows
                    more distant.<br>
                    <br>
                    The boat cuts quickly through the sea. Max
                    looks past the bow toward his destination.
                    There is nothing but open water.

                    <b>EXT. OCEAN - DAWN</b>
                    <br><br>
                    A pale early light paints the ocean pink. We
                    see a wide, wide shot, with Max and his boat
                    a tiny speck in the vast ocean.<br>
                    <br>
                    On board, we see Max look around at the
                    horizon line. In front of him, no signs of the
                    city. Behind him is just water and sky. No land
                    in sight.<br>
                    <br>
                    He settles in for a long journey.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max sails in and out of nights and days. He's
                    hungry and thirsty. Rain comes and goes.
                    He's cold and wet and exhausted and it
                    seems he'll never see land again. Finally, after
                    many days, off the bow of the boat, he sees a
                    landmass, and within it, a bright glow.
                    <br><br>
                    He's closer now. The island is in
                    sight. A great black mound in the sea, with an
                    orange glow a fire in the middle.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>EXT. ISLAND - NIGHT</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Landing on the beach is roughgoing. The surf
                    is thundering, and Max's boat is tossed about
                    like a toy.<br>
                    <br>
                    When he's close enough, he jumps from the
                    boat, gasping from the water's cold. He gets
                    his bearings and pulls the boat ashore. He
                    stands and assesses the island.<br>
                    <br>
                    Beyond the beach and the bluffs above, he
                    sees a forest with a large fire raging. The
                    flames ebbs and flow, bursting periodically
                    like a growing bonfire.
                    <br><br>
                    There are sounds of chaos in the distance,
                    audible even from the beach. Max, wet and
                    cold, knows his only chance at survival is to
                    climb the cliffs and move toward the warmth
                    of the fire.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max skulks through the foliage like a cat.
                    This is a truly dangerous, muddy forest wild,
                    primal and unpredictable. As the sounds get
                    louder, Max comes upon a clearing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Through the trees Max sees an enormous
                    fire. Around it are ten large huts, made of
                    interlocking branches. Max stays low. A huge
                    creature appears in silhouette, backlit by
                    the fire. Hiding in the grass, Max watches,
                    enthralled.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max studies this creature as he walks around,
                    crushing one of these huts with his enormous
                    arms. This beast is CAROL huge, striped and
                    with two horns atop his head.

                        CAROL<br>
                        No, no it was crazy already. I'm eliminating the crazy. Isn't anyone on my side? Isn't anyone gonna be on my side anymore?<br>
                    </p>
                    Everyone stands in silence. Nobody answers. Carol looks sad.
                    Close on Max, as he feels for Carol and relates to him.

                    </p>
                    Hold on Carol, as he simmers. It's finally quiet.

                    He starts to smash another hut.

                        But I know what I'm doing.
                    </p>
                    From far away, Carol hears a sound. It sounds like a small animal growling.<br>
                    <br>
                    Carol looks around to see what this noise is. It's getting louder. Everybody looks around to see what it is.<br>
                    <br>
                    Suddenly Max bursts into the scene, flying through the side of a hut. He startles everybody. Wildly, he swings a huge stick around, destroying everything in his path.
                    <p id="talk">

                    </p>
                    Carol watches Max, excited by what he sees, but also unsure about who or what this thing is.<br>
                    <br>
                    As Max is smashing stuff, he exchanges glances with Carol. Max hurls himself into one of the huts and lands on the ground, in a comic thud. Carol approaches Max, looms over him and sniffs him. Max is nervous, but sniffs Carol back. They growl at each other. Carol laughs.

                    Carol runs off, smashing a hut on the
                    other side.<br>
                    <br>
                    With his big stick, Max approaches one of the last remaining huts. He smashes it and creates a large hole. Inside the hut. Max is surprised to see a large and menacing bulllike creature, THE BULL. Max is frightened, and backs off. When he turns around, he bumps into Douglas, who looms over him.<br>

                    They stare at Max. Max is growing more and more concerned with the direction this is heading.

                    The creatures circle in on Max as they discuss eating him. Max looks from one Wild Thing to the other, as Judith, Ira, Alexander and the Bull grow closer. Carol is still on the other side of the clearing, smashing the last of the huts.

                    The Wild Things continue to close in on him. He arches his back and lets out a voice much greater and more commanding than we could ever expect:

                    Max is acting like hes casting a spell on them. The Wild Things freeze in their tracks. All is silent. Carol, far off, hears the commotion and heads over.
                    Theres a split second when Max cant believe it worked. But theres still tension.

                        They wear horn hats, and they're big bigger than you! One time they attacked me in my ice fortress. They tried to cave in the roof, but I'd made it too strong. I told them to be still but they didn't. I conquered them. I had to make their heads explode. And then they realized I knew all the secrets to the world. And then you know what happened? They made me their king.

                        MAX<br>
                        Then I have a recracker that goes right through that.<br>
                        <br>
                        JUDITH<br>
                        But what if we have some sort of material that recrackers can't get through?<br>
                        <br>
                        MAX<br>
                        Well, I have a double recracker that can get through any material in the whole universe and there's no material outside of this universe that it can't get through, and that's the end and there's nothing more powerful than that and that's the end. Period.<br>

                        IRA<br>
                        Wow, he does
                        sound powerful.<br>

                        Yeah, but there has to be some material somewhere, maybe really deep underground that if&mdash;<br>

                        Yeah, I have a sadness shield. It keeps out all the sadness and it's big enough for all of us.<br>

                    We see a stringyhaired female Wild Thing, standing off to the side. She has a blase sort of attitude. Carol looks over, surprised and nervous.

                    Carol looks over, cautiously studying her. K.W. is checking out Max and tentatively making eye contact with Carol.

                    Max studies her, trying to get a read on her. She checks himout, too.

                    </p>
                    Carol leads Max over to a pile of smoking ashes. Max passes K.W., still trying to get a read on her.<br>
                    <br>
                    Carol and the Bull guide Max to a smoldering fire. Judith, Ira, Douglas and Alexander all linger behind and watch solemnly.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Bull passes by Max and roots around in some rubble on the ground. Carol is standing a distance away, hands clasped behind his back very much the guy who pulls the strings.<br>

                K.W. rolls her eyes and walks off.<br>
                <br>
                The Bull takes a scepter from the ashes and hands it to Max. Max inspects the scepter reverently, and when he holds it, he instantly looks kinglike. Carol smiles at him. Max watches as the Bull roots around for the crown. Amid the ashes, Max sees a pile of bones. The Bull finds the crown near a rib or femur, and gives it to Carol.

                Max looks uncertain. He looks at Carol, and then the other wild things. Ira gives him a big smile. Max smiles back.

                As Max is lifted onto a destroyed hut, the Bull bonks Max's head into a branch. They all gather around Max, looking up at him. They all chant.

                They all cheer. It was the right thing to say. They celebrate. Judith shoves Ira.

                Max jumps off the hut and starts growling at the Wild Things. They make a circle around him and growl back, imitating him. He acts like a monkey, and they act like monkeys. Max makes a crazy rolling <i>RRRR</i> sound at Carol. Carol gleefully does it back. Max is in the center of it all, loving it. K.W. watches from afar, gauging the effect that Max has had on everyone. Max takes off through the forest, and everyone follows him.

                They run through the forest. Douglas trips over a fallen tree. Judith leaps over the
                tree, kicking Douglas in the head. They all keep going.<br>
                <br>
                Max falls, gets up. The running and howling continues.

                <b>EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAWN (BEFORE SUNRISE)</b>
                <br><br>
                Max runs up a small incline to a clearing on top of a cliff. He circles a tree, dragging his claws on it. The Wild Things do the same, but their claws shred the bark off of it.<br>
                <br>
                They all run up to the cliff, howling with Max. Because Max is standing close to the edge and they're careless, they almost knock him off the cliff with someone's hip. Carol immediately catches Max and places him back on the ground. It's comic, but also reminds us that there's danger still on this island.<br>
                <br>
                Together Max and the Wild Things stand at the edge of the cliff, howling into the air over the vast ocean below.

                </p>
                It's a glorious moment. Max looks all around him, at the happy faces of the giant beasts. They're all howling with abandon. Now Max notices that K.W. has joined them. She looks amused.

                Carol notices Max and K.W. interacting and tries to get Max's attention back.

                Max's attention is diverted by Carol. He's left the cliff and is now returning into the forest, jumping high in the air like a frog but with a thunderous thump each time he lands.<br>
                <br>
                Max sees Carol's jumping skill and has an idea. He chases after him into the forest, trying to get his attention.

                    I hope you can tell how excited they are to have a king. Sometimes they have an odd way of showing it. I mean, not me, but sometimes they act weird, you know and it hurts other people's feelings.<br>

                She grabs his face, as if she's a doctor and has seen some terrible lesion. Once she's got him, she licks Max from chin to forehead, and then laughs hysterically.<br>

                A loud crack behind them. The sound of a tree beginning tofall it's one that Douglas has punched. Max and Ira scatter as it comes down with a great crash.

                Max runs down the log and leaps onto K.W.'s back with a happy growl. Surprised, she stumbles back and falls to the ground, laughing. Max rolls off, his crown tumbling off. K.W. laughs. Max jumps back up and leaps on her. He begins to tickle her. He sticks his finger in her nose.

                    DOUGLAS<br>
                    That's true, Carol.<br>
                    <br>
                    CAROL<br>
                    I mean, I didn't, but...

                Max starts crawling through the nooks and crannies of the bodies there are small, Maxsize tunnels. Max decides to tickle everyone. They all laugh. The walls of the tunnels shift as Wild Things wriggle and giggle.

                    CAROL<br>
                    Hey, K.W., your toe's in my ear.<br>
                    <br>
                    K.W.<br>
                    Good! You're keeping it warm.<br>
                    <br>
                    CAROL<br>
                    Hey, who's on my face?<br>
                    <br>
                    IRA<br>
                    Oh, I'm sorry Carol. Let me move.<br>
                    <br>
                    DOUGLAS<br>
                    Oh, I like this.<br>
                    <br>
                    IRA<br>
                    That was a great rumpus.<br>
                    <br>
                    DOUGLAS<br>
                    Let's be like this forever.

                Someone's body moves and pins Max's leg.
                <p id="talk">
                    MAX<br>
                    Owww.
                </p>
                Max tries to get his leg unstuck but can't. It's claustrophobic and he's getting nervous.<br>
                <br>
                Suddenly... in the wall of bodies, a head turns, and a pairof huge eyes open, like two lamps being turned on. It's K.W. Max looks up.
                <p id="talk">
                    K.W.<br>
                    The king having a problem?<br>
                    <br>
                    MAX<br>
                    (worried)<br>
                    My foot's stuck under this fat guy.
                </p>
                With her free arm, she pushes someone's blubber off and extricates his foot.
                <p id="talk">
                    K.W.<br>
                    Oh. There.<br>
                    <br>
                    MAX<br>
                    Thanks.<br>
                    <br>
                    K.W.<br>
                    I'm K.W.<br>
                    <br>
                    MAX<br>
                    I'm Max.<br>
                    <br>
                    K.W.<br>
                    I know.
                </p>
                K.W. looks at Max grinning for a moment.
                <p id="talk">
                    MAX<br>
                    So are you gonna stay?<br>
                    <br>
                    K.W.<br>
                    Well...<br>
                    <br>
                    MAX<br>
                    They all want you to.
                </p>
                This seems to soften K.W.
                <p id="talk">
                    K.W.<br>
                    Well, it's complicated.<br>
                    (she looks confused)<br>
                    I don't even know how everything got this way. Things seem better now, though.
                </p>
                K.W. smiles.
                <p id="talk">
                    K.W.<br>
                    (teasing him for being so
                    bossy)<br>
                    Okay, King.<br>
                    <br>
                    MAX<br>
                    So who are Bob and Terry?<br>
                    <br>
                    K.W.<br>
                    Oh they're really good friends of mine. I don't even know how to describe them, they're just different from everybody here.<br>
                    (meaningfully)<br>
                    ... It's just different.<br>
                    <br>
                    MAX<br>
                    Well, do you like them more than--<br>
                    <br>
                    K.W.<br>
                    (interrupting him)<br>
                    You ask a lot of questions. What's your story? Why'd you come here?<br>
                    <br>
                    MAX<br>
                    Well...<br>
                    (thoughtfully)<br>
                    I'm an explorer and I travel a lot. And I travel by sea...<br>
                    <br>
                    K.W.<br>
                    Right...<br>
                    <br>
                    MAX<br>
                    I used to travel by air.<br>
                    <br>
                    K.W.<br>
Oh, so obviously you have no home or family?
MAX
I had one of those... but I...
K.W.
But you ate ‘em all.
MAX
No, no! I just bit one of em, and then they went crazy.
