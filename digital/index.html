                <b>INT. MAX&rsquo;S HOME &ndash; EVENING 1</b>
                <br><br>
                Black screen: Echoing through a house, we hear A BOY BARKING and A DOG YELPING.
                The picture comes up and a raggedy black dog tears down a set of stairs, toward us.
                <br><br>
                MAX, eight years old and wearing a white wolf suit, jumps down the stairs, tumbling toward the camera, growling and chasing the dog. For some reason, Max is holding a fork.
                <br><br>
                He jumps to the bottom of the stairs tucking and rolling, screeching a feral war&ndash;cry and follows the dog off&ndash;screen.
                <br><br>
                Max chases the dog under the dining room table and closes in. He leaps and grabs the dog, and howling and somersaulting, they wrestle happily together until the screen freezes.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>EXT. SNOW&ndash;COVERED SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD &ndash; DAY</b>
                <br><br>
                Max&rsquo;s legs protrude from a hand&ndash;dug opening in a large snow embankment &ndash; a remnant of the morning&rsquo;s snowplows.
                <br><br>
                He crawls out and stands over it, surveying his creation. A proud and crooked grin spreads across his face.
                <br><br>
                He runs off toward his house, wanting badly to tell someone
                about it.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>INT./EXT. MAX&rsquo;S HOME &ndash; DAY</b>
                <br><br>
                Max runs up to the window and taps on the glass. Inside is his sister Claire, 14, talking on the phone with great intensity. We see only Max&rsquo;s eyes peering over the window sill.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    <u><u>MAX</u></u>

                    <br>
                    Hey Claire! Wanna see something great?
                </p>
                Claire is too involved in her phone call to pay Max any attention.

                    <br>
                    It&rsquo;s an igloo.

                    <br>
                    I made it.
                </p>
                Claire doesn&rsquo;t respond. Her phone call is very important to her.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    <u>CLAIRE</u>

                    <br>
                    Yeah, my brother.
                    No, I can&rsquo;t.
                    <br>We&rsquo;re supposed to go to my dad&rsquo;s that weekend.
                    <br><br>
                    <u><u>MAX</u></u>
                    <br>
                    The snowplows left some snow across
                    the street... and I dug a hole into
                    it.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>CLAIRE</u>
                    <br>
                    Max, go play with your friends!
                </p>
                Max is crushed. He walks off, dejected.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>INT. IGLOO &ndash; DAY</b>
                <br><br>
                Max sits, resting in his igloo, deep in thought. He exits the igloo with a makeshift flag &ndash; a plastic bag tied to a birch twig. He marches over to a nearby wooden fence and barks orders to it.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    <u><u>MAX</u></u>
                    <br>
                    You! Go that way! You! Go that way!
                </p>
                The fence isn&rsquo;t responding. Max kicks it.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    <u><u>MAX</u></u>
                    
                    <br>
                    Don&rsquo;t talk to me like that. You&rsquo;re just a fence. Go play with your own fence friends. Now move out!
                </p>
            
                He runs to his fort and carefully secures his flag to the top. He adjusts it two or three times to make it just right. Max is something of a perfectionist.
                <br><br>
                Just then, Max watches as a car pulls into his driveway. Max sees a group of teenage boys and girls get out of the car and lope into his house.
                <br><br>
                Max gets an idea. He jumps into his igloo and scoops up all of his snowballs. He can&rsquo;t carry them all so he hurriedly rolls them out the entrance.
                <br><br>
                He runs across the street to his house, closer to his prey, carefully balancing his ammunition on his coat, kangaroo style. He hides behind the neighbor&rsquo;s low fence.
                <br><br>
                He waits, excitedly, organizing his arsenal while stealthily peering over the fence. He watches the teens while they&rsquo;re inside his house. Meanwhile, he makes more snowballs.
                <br><br>
                The teenagers come outside with Claire. Max holds a snowball, giddy with anticipation. He waits until they&rsquo;re close enough and then jumps up and unleashes his projectiles. His aim isn&rsquo;t so good, but he has the element of surprise on his side. A few snowballs hit the teenagers, and when they see that it&rsquo;s him, they laugh and start throwing snowballs back. The fight is on.
                <br><br>
                As Max is reloading, a large mound of snow is dumped on his back. The boys are close now, on the other side of the fence. It&rsquo;s time to retreat. Max bolts. He runs across the street, giddy&ndash;the thrill of battle.
                <br><br>
                He gets to his fort just in time and dives inside. He slides into his little cave &ndash; nervous and happy. He&rsquo;s safe.
                <br><br>
                But the boys are upon him. Through the fort&rsquo;s entrance, he sees them approach.
                <br><br>
                An arm comes through the side, searching for Max. Max squirms out of the way, his eyes wide with alarm.
                <br><br>
                Then there&rsquo;s a sickening crunch from above. Another crunch. They&rsquo;re on the roof. Max looks up. The ceiling caves in.
                <br><br>
                Max is trapped in a world of cold white.
                <br><br>
                He claws his way out of the top, and we see his face, red, wet with snow and tears. He&rsquo;s cold and humiliated.
                <br><br>
                The two boys see how upset Max is. They pull back, feeling awful. They walk back across the street.
                <br><br>
                A horn honks &ndash; everyone is waiting. The boys run back to the car.
                <br><br>
                Max, hurt and shamed, looks for Claire among the teenagers. He finds her. Max and Claire lock eyes. Claire looks worried and feels bad for Max. Max hopes that Claire will come over, to help and comfort him &ndash; even to stick up for him.
                <br><br>
                But she doesn&rsquo;t. She turns away to talk to someone in the car. The car, with Claire in it, drives away. Shaken and raw, Max runs to the house.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>INT. MAX&rsquo;S HOME &ndash; LATE AFTERNOON (CONTINUOUS)</b>
                <br><br>
                Max enters his house covered in snow, and runs upstairs into Claire&rsquo;s room.
                <br><br>
                Max rips off his hat and gloves and throws them on the floor. He jumps up and down on Claire&rsquo;s bed, dumping snow everywhere. On her dresser, he sees an elaborate valentine that he made her out of popsicle sticks and construction paper. It says <i>"To Claire. Love, Max."</i> He grabs it and tears it to pieces.
                <br><br>
                As he calms down he realizes what he&rsquo;s done. He picks up the pieces of the valentine and walks to his room.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>INT. <u>MAX</u>&rsquo;S BEDROOM</b>
                <br><br>
                Max lays in bed, silent, worried. On the dresser next to his bed is a globe, an antique, lit from within. Max reads the inscription on a small brass panel on the globe:
                <br><br>
                <i>TO <u>MAX</u>, OWNER OF THIS WORLD. Love, Dad</i>
                <br><br>
                He hears high heels clicking in the kitchen below. Max looks forlorn, wishing he hadn&rsquo;t done what he&rsquo;s done. His mom&rsquo;s footsteps echo through the house, getting closer to the stairs.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">
                    <u><u>MOM</u></u>

                </p>
                We hear her walking upstairs. She enters the room and sees Max under his covers. She sits down on his bed and kisses his head. She&rsquo;s wearing her work clothes &ndash; a wool skirt and white cotton blouse.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">

                    Hey.
                </p>
                Max doesn&rsquo;t answer.

                    What&rsquo;s wrong?
                </p>
                Max looks up.
                <br>
                <p id="talk">

                    <u><u>MAX</u></u><br>
                    And she didn&rsquo;t do anything about it.
                    <br><br>
                    <u><u>MOM</u></u><br>
                    I&rsquo;m sorry, honey.<br>
                    (with a sly smile)<br>
                    I would have done something about it.
                </p>
                    The guilt overtakes Max.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>INT. CLAIRE&rsquo;S BEDROOM &ndash; CONTINUOUS</b>
                    <br><br>
                    He brings his mom into Claire&rsquo;s room. Water squishes underfoot.

                    </p>
                    She leaves the room and comes back with a stack of towels. They both drop to their knees to soak up the mess.

                    <b>INT. <u>MOM</u>&rsquo;S OFFICE AREA &ndash; NIGHT (LATER)</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Max&rsquo;s mom works at home at night in a room at the rear of the house. Overlooking the backyard, it&rsquo;s a room used for many purposes. Outside, the snow has turned to rain and it&rsquo;s coming down, silver streaks outside the window.
                    <br><br>
                    Mom is typing on her computer, an older model, while talking on the phone to a co&ndash;worker. Max enters the room tentatively.
                    <br><br>
                    Feeling a bit guilty about earlier, Max wants to make up with his mom. He fiddles with a few things in the room, circling his mom without overtly asking for attention.
                    <br><br>
                    Mom, still not paying any mind to Max, looks anxious &ndash; but more than that, simply tired and worn out. As she continues her phone conversation, we catch only glimpses of her from Max&rsquo;s point of view.
                    <br>
                    <p id="talk">

                        No, I don&rsquo;t want to bother you, just... just quickly can you tell me exactly what Mr. Lasseter didn&rsquo;t like about the report? ...Well what am I suppose to do? No, I&rsquo;m just tired and there&rsquo;s been some stuff here at home.... So what can I do to fix this?
                    </p>
                    Max, trying to make her smile, adopts the posture of a robot.
                    <br><br>
                    She looks over to him. He continues walking robot&ndash;style and turns his head to smile at her, not noticing he&rsquo;s about to walk into the wall. He falls down, to comic effect. His mom buries a laugh and puts her finger to her lips, telling Max to shush. Max grins. Success.

                    </p>
                    He plops himself on the floor under her desk and looks at his mom&rsquo;s feet. She&rsquo;s taken off her shoes, but is still wearing her tights; Max tugs gently on the tights over her right toe.

                    She hangs up and smiles down at Max.

                        Okay, there were some buildings... There were these really tall buildings...and they could walk. Then there were some vampires. One of the vampires bit the tallest building and his fangs broke off...then all his other teeth fell out...then he started crying...and then all the other vampires said Why are you crying? Aren&rsquo;t those just your baby teeth? And he said, No, those are my grownup teeth...and the vampires knew that he couldn&rsquo;t be a vampire anymore, so they left him.

                    The classroom is a familiar one Formica furniture and a chalkboard, large windows. The branches of nearby trees touch the glass when the wind surges. Max&rsquo;s teacher, male, is short and thin, bearded and wearing a cardigan.

                        ... the sun is the center of our solar system. It&rsquo;s the reason all the planets are here. Its warmth gives us sunlight, makes our planet liveable. Of course the sun won&rsquo;t always be here to keep us warm. It, like all things, will die... and when it does, first it&rsquo;ll expand, enveloping all the surrounding planets, including Earth, before consuming them rapidly.<br>

                        The sun, after all, is just fuel burning ferociously... and when it runs out of fuel... well... it&rsquo;ll be gone. Well after that, the solar system will go dark... permanently.

                    Max is silently horrified.
                    He looks around, studying
                    the faces of his friends.

                    involved. He stands.

                        Max, what is wrong
                        with you? Why are you
                        doing these things?<br>

                    </p>
                    Max looks at everyone. His mom, the
                    boyfriend...

                    </p>
                    This is the last straw with Max. He turns red
                    with rage and runs out of the house, into the
                    night. His mom runs out the door after him.

                    She follows him for a block, but quickly loses
                    ground.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max cuts across yards and down an
                    embankment. Now he&rsquo;s free. He runs toward
                    the forest in the distance, where the road
                    ends and the trees begin.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>EXT. NEARBY FOREST &ndash; NIGHT</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Max, still high from the run and still breathing
                    hard, comes into the forest.<br>
                    <br>
                    He reaches a small clearing around a fallen
                    tree, where he has a few possessions stashed.
                    Max grabs a large stick and stomps around,
                    hitting things violently.
                    <br><br>
                    The wind blows louder, whipping the leaves
                    around in a fury. Max, feeling the night&rsquo;s
                    power, howls into the sky.<br>
                    <br>
                    He finds himself at the shore. The stars are
                    out and themoon is reflected on the placid
                    water.<br>
                    <br>
                    A boat floats. Max looks around to see
                    if anyone is there. The boat isn&rsquo;t tied to
                    anything, and starts to drift away. Max rushes
                    toward it and grabs the loose rope attached
                    to it. He pulls the boat back slowly. He looks
                    around again, wondering if the boat has an
                    owner, if anyone&rsquo;s watching. He stands
                    before the boat, the trees swaying violently
                    around him.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max steps into the boat. The vessel slowly
                    drifts away.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max allows the boat to drift, watching
                    seriously and intentionally as the land grows
                    more distant.<br>
                    <br>
                    The boat cuts quickly through the sea. Max
                    looks past the bow toward his destination.
                    There is nothing but open water.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>EXT. OCEAN &ndash; DAWN</b>
                    <br><br>
                    A pale early light paints the ocean pink. We
                    see a wide, wide shot, with Max and his boat
                    a tiny speck in the vast ocean.<br>
                    <br>
                    On board, we see Max look around at the
                    horizon line. In front of him, no signs of the
                    city. Behind him is just water and sky. No land
                    in sight.<br>
                    <br>
                    He settles in for a long journey.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max sails in and out of nights and days. He&rsquo;s
                    hungry and thirsty. Rain comes and goes.
                    He&rsquo;s cold and wet and exhausted and it
                    seems he&rsquo;ll never see land again. Finally, after
                    many days, off the bow of the boat, he sees a
                    landmass, and within it, a bright glow.
                    <br><br>
                    He&rsquo;s closer now. The island is in
                    sight. A great black mound in the sea, with an
                    orange glow a fire in the middle.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>EXT. ISLAND &ndash; NIGHT</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Landing on the beach is roughgoing. The surf
                    is thundering, and Max&rsquo;s boat is tossed about
                    like a toy.<br>
                    <br>
                    When he&rsquo;s close enough, he jumps from the
                    boat, gasping from the water&rsquo;s cold. He gets
                    his bearings and pulls the boat ashore. He
                    stands and assesses the island.<br>
                    <br>
                    Beyond the beach and the bluffs above, he
                    sees a forest with a large fire raging. The
                    flames ebbs and flow, bursting periodically
                    like a growing bonfire.
                    <br><br>
                    There are sounds of chaos in the distance,
                    audible even from the beach. Max, wet and
                    cold, knows his only chance at survival is to
                    climb the cliffs and move toward the warmth
                    of the fire.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max skulks through the foliage like a cat.
                    This is a truly dangerous, muddy forest wild,
                    primal and unpredictable. As the sounds get
                    louder, Max comes upon a clearing.<br>
                    <br>
                    Through the trees Max sees an enormous
                    fire. Around it are ten large huts, made of
                    interlocking branches. Max stays low. A huge
                    creature appears in silhouette, backlit by
                    the fire. Hiding in the grass, Max watches,
                    enthralled.<br>
                    <br>
                    Max studies this creature as he walks around,
                    crushing one of these huts with his enormous
                    arms. This beast CAROL huge, striped and
                    with two horns atop his head.

                    JUDITH is female, with two horns and one
                    prominent at the end of her huge snout. Her

                    IRA is close to Judith, and has a huge oval

                        <br>
                        <u><u>JUDITH</u></u><br>
                        (exasperated)<br>
                        Good idea, Ira. Go stand in this hut over here before it gets wrecked.<br>
                        <br>
                        <u><u>IRA</u></u><br>
                        I know, I know I shouldn&rsquo;t.<br>
                        <br>
                        <u><u>JUDITH</u></u><br>
                        Ira, go stand in the hut over there so I can think.<br>
                        <br>
                        <u><u>IRA</u></u><br>
                        I&rsquo;ll stand right over here.
                    </p>
                    Ira walks over to the hut and gets in. Carol flies in from above and smashes the hut.

                    </p>
                    Everyone stands in silence. Nobody answers. Carol looks sad.
                    Close on Max, as he feels for Carol and relates to him.

                    He starts to smash another hut.

                        But I know what I&rsquo;m doing.
                    </p>
                    From far away, Carol hears a sound. It sounds like a small animal growling.<br>
                    <br>
                    Carol looks around to see what this noise is. It&rsquo;s getting louder. Everybody looks around to see what it is.<br>
                    <br>
                    Suddenly Max bursts into the scene, flying through the side of a hut. He startles everybody. Wildly, he swings a huge stick around, destroying everything in his path.
                    <p id="talk">

                    </p>
                    Carol watches Max, excited by what he sees, but also unsure about who or what this thing is.<br>
                    <br>
                    As Max is smashing stuff, he exchanges glances with Carol. Max hurls himself into one of the huts and lands on the ground, in a comic thud. Carol approaches Max, looms over him and sniffs him. Max is nervous, but sniffs Carol back. They growl at each other. Carol laughs.

                    Carol runs off, smashing a hut on the
                    other side.<br>
                    <br>
                    With his big stick, Max approaches one of the last remaining huts. He smashes it and creates a large hole. Inside the hut. Max is surprised to see a large and menacing bulllike creature, THE BULL. Max is frightened, and backs off. When he turns around, he bumps into Douglas, who looms over him.<br>

                    The creatures circle in on Max as they discuss eating him. Max looks from one Wild Thing to the other, as Judith, Ira, Alexander and the Bull grow closer. Carol is still on the other side of the clearing, smashing the last of the huts.

                    Theyre breathing hard. Their teeth are gigantic. Ira licks his lips. The Bull snorts. Max looks up at them, panicked, backed into a corner. He has to do something.

                    The Wild Things continue to close in on him. He arches his back and lets out a voice much greater and more commanding than we could ever expect:
                    <p id="talk">

                    Max is acting like hes casting a spell on them. The Wild Things freeze in their tracks. All is silent. Carol, far off, hears the commotion and heads over.
                    Theres a split second when Max cant believe it worked. But theres still tension.

                        They wear horn hats, and they&rsquo;re big bigger than you! One time they attacked me in my ice fortress. They tried to cave in the roof, but I&rsquo;d made it too strong. I told them to be still but they didn&rsquo;t. I conquered them. I had to make their heads explode. And then they realized I knew all the secrets to the world. And then you know what happened? They made me their king.

                        <u>CAROL</u></u><br>
                        (seriously)<br>
                        You were a king? I knew there was something special about him. I told you guys.
                    </p>
                    The other Wild Things are trying to take this all in, overwhelmed with all of this new information.

                        But you&rsquo;re so small.<br>

                        <u><u>MAX</u></u><br>
                        Small is good. My powers are able to slip right through the cracks.<br>

                        <u><u>MAX</u></u><br>
                        Then I have a recracker that goes right through that.<br>
                        <br>
                        <u><u>JUDITH</u></u><br>

                        <br>
                        <u><u>MAX</u></u><br>
                        Well, I have a double recracker that can get through any material in the whole universe and there&rsquo;s no material outside of this universe that it can&rsquo;t get through, and that&rsquo;s the end and there&rsquo;s nothing more powerful than that and that&rsquo;s the end.

                        <u><u>MAX</u></u><br>
                        Yeah, I have a sadness shield. It keeps out all the sadness and it&rsquo;s big enough for all of us.<br>

                        I don&rsquo;t understand. He doesn&rsquo;t look like a king. If he could be king, I could be king.<br>

                    Max studies them, looking at all of their faces in need, waiting for his answer.

                    </p>
                    We see a stringyhaired female Wild Thing, standing off to the side. She has a blase sort of attitude. Carol looks over, surprised and nervous.

                    Carol looks over, cautiously studying her. K.W. is checking out Max and tentatively making eye contact with Carol.

                        Hey, K.W. we got a king! You and me could go for a walk and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it. Anytime. You could carry me like a little baby.<br>

                        <u>K.W</u><br>
                        Uh... yeah. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t even know if I&rsquo;m sticking around. I just came back to...<br>
                        (beat, looking at Carol)<br>
                        ...to get that one stick I left here. Anyone see it?
                    </p>
                    Max studies her, trying to get a read on her. She checks himout, too.

                        Shh, shh. Stop. Don&rsquo;t push her. She&rsquo;ll figure it out for herself. Just leave her be, okay?<br>
                        (to Max)<br>
                        King. This way your majesty, please.
                    </p>
                    Carol leads Max over to a pile of smoking ashes. Max passes K.W., still trying to get a read on her.<br>
                    <br>
                    Carol and the Bull guide Max to a smoldering fire. Judith, Ira, Douglas and Alexander all linger behind and watch solemnly.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Bull passes by Max and roots around in some rubble on the ground. Carol is standing a distance away, hands clasped behind his back very much the guy who pulls the strings.<br>
                    <br>

                </p>
                Judith lights up momentarily then catches herself.

                    Yeah, but happiness isn&rsquo;t always the best way to be happy.<br>
                    <br>

                    He&rsquo;s small for a king. Am I nuts? He&rsquo;s small.<br>

                    <u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
                    I like it better when we have a king.<br>
                    (beat)<br>
                    I like Carol better when we have a king.<br>
                    <br>
                    K.W.<br>
                    Hey, what happened to our houses?<br>
                    <br>
                    <u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
                    (lying to cover for Carol)<br>
                    Oh... um, they fell down.
                </p>
                K.W. rolls her eyes and walks off.<br>
                <br>
                The Bull takes a scepter from the ashes and hands it to Max. Max inspects the scepter reverently, and when he holds it, he instantly looks kinglike. Carol smiles at him. Max watches as the Bull roots around for the crown. Amid the ashes, Max sees a pile of bones. The Bull finds the crown near a rib or femur, and gives it to Carol.
                <p id="talk">
                    <u>MAX</u><br>

                </p>
                Max looks uncertain. He looks at Carol, and then the other wild things. Ira gives him a big smile. Max smiles back.

                Carol crowns Max.

                    And you will be a truly great king.
                </p>
                Max grins with pride, looking up, trying to see the crown on his head.

                </p>
                The Bull reaches down to pick up Max, to show him off to the others.

                As Max is lifted onto a destroyed hut, the Bull bonks Max&rsquo;s head into a branch. They all gather around Max, looking up at him. They all chant.

                They all cheer. It was the right thing to say. They celebrate. Judith shoves Ira.

                </p>
                Max jumps off the hut and starts growling at the Wild Things. They make a circle around him and growl back, imitating him. He acts like a monkey, and they act like monkeys. Max makes a crazy rolling <i>RRRR</i> sound at Carol. Carol gleefully does it back. Max is in the center of it all, loving it. K.W. watches from afar, gauging the effect that Max has had on everyone. Max takes off through the forest, and everyone follows him.

                They run through the forest. Douglas trips over a fallen tree. Judith leaps over the
                tree, kicking Douglas in the head. They all keep going.<br>
                <br>
                Max falls, gets up. The running and howling continues.

                <br><br>
                Max runs up a small incline to a clearing on top of a cliff. He circles a tree, dragging his claws on it. The Wild Things do the same, but their claws shred the bark off of it.<br>
                <br>
                They all run up to the cliff, howling with Max. Because Max is standing close to the edge and they&rsquo;re careless, they almost knock him off the cliff with someone&rsquo;s hip. Carol immediately catches Max and places him back on the ground. It&rsquo;s comic, but also reminds us that there&rsquo;s danger still on this island.<br>
                <br>
                Together Max and the Wild Things stand at the edge of the cliff, howling into the air over the vast ocean below.

                It&rsquo;s a glorious moment. Max looks all around him, at the happy faces of the giant beasts. They&rsquo;re all howling with abandon. Now Max notices that K.W. has joined them. She looks amused.

                Max&rsquo;s attention is diverted by Carol. He&rsquo;s left the cliff and is now returning into the forest, jumping high in the air like a frog but with a thunderous thump each time he lands.<br>
                <br>
                Max sees Carol&rsquo;s jumping skill and has an idea. He chases after him into the forest, trying to get his attention.

                    I hope you can tell how excited they are to have a king. Sometimes they have an odd way of showing it. I mean, not me, but sometimes they act weird, you know and it hurts other people&rsquo;s feelings.<br>

                    <u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
                    (turning to see Max running toward K.W., urgently)<br>
                    Uh, King, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend that.
                </p>
                Max runs down the log and leaps onto K.W.&rsquo;s back with a happy growl. Surprised, she stumbles back and falls to the ground, laughing. Max rolls off, his crown tumbling off. K.W. laughs. Max jumps back up and leaps on her. He begins to tickle her. He sticks his finger in her nose.
                <p id="talk">
                    <u>K.W.</u><br>
                    (laughing)<br>
                    Stop, stop. Stop it, stop it!
                    Go pick someone else&rsquo;s nose!
                </p>
                Carol&rsquo;s expression is one of relief and happiness. He&rsquo;s excited that she&rsquo;s having fun. Carol runs to join in. K.W. rolls over, protecting Max as Carol lands on them.

                </p>
                One by one all the Wild Things jump on.

                Soon they&rsquo;re all in a huge heap on top of each other. When Max looks up, he&rsquo;s inside a gigantic pile of Wild Thing bodies. Everyone is laughing and groaning from the weight. We hear bits of what they&rsquo;re saying:

                </p>
                Max starts crawling through the nooks and crannies of the bodies there are small, Maxsize tunnels. Max decides to tickle everyone. They all laugh. The walls of the tunnels shift as Wild Things wriggle and giggle.

                Someone&rsquo;s body moves and pins Max&rsquo;s leg.

                Max tries to get his leg unstuck but can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s claustrophobic and he&rsquo;s getting nervous.<br>
                <br>
                Suddenly... in the wall of bodies, a head turns, and a pairof huge eyes open, like two lamps being turned on. It&rsquo;s K.W. Max looks up.

                    I&rsquo;m an explorer and I travel a lot. And I travel by sea...<br>

                    <u>MAX</u><br>
                    I used to travel by air.<br>

                    <u>K.W.</u><br>
					Oh, so obviously you have no home or family?<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					I had one of those... but I...<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					But you ate &lsquo;em all.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					No, no! I just bit one of em, and then they went crazy.<br>
					(beat, talking to himself, justifying his position)<br>
					I don&rsquo;t like frozen corn.<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					(sweetly)<br>
					Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry. That&rsquo;s why you left?<br>
					<br>

					(with a feeling of loss)<br>
					Yeah.<br>
					(mad)<br>
					They act like I&rsquo;m a bad person.<br>

					Well, are you?<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(worried)<br>
					I don&rsquo;t know.<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Well, I&rsquo;m glad you came. It&rsquo;ll be good to have someone around who doesn&rsquo;t eat everybody. I mean, you just bite everyone. Biters aren&rsquo;t so bad, eaters are the one&rsquo;s I just can&rsquo;t stand.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					I have no plans to eat anybody.<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Alright, good.<br>
					(beat)<br>
					Well, good night.

				Max crawls out of the middle of the pile. As he does so, the Wild Things exchange &ldquo;good nights&rdquo; with each other.

				</p>
				Once outside the pile, Max settles on the edge, putting his head on someone&rsquo;s leg. It&rsquo;s morning now.<br>
				<br>
				Max has been up all night. In the orange light of dawn, Max sees debris everywhere, like a landscape after a hurricane.<br>
				<br>
				Max reaches in to get his crown and puts
				it on. Happy and exhausted, he drifts off
				to sleep.<br>
				<br><br>
				<b>EXT. BEAUTIFUL FOREST &ndash; MORNING</b>
				<br><br>
				We start in close on Max as he wakes up. Disoriented, he realizes he&rsquo;s on the shoulders of a Wild Thing, being carried high above the ground. He looks down. It&rsquo;s Carol.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					I didn&rsquo;t want to wake you up, but I really want to show you something.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Oh, okay.
				</p>
				Now waking up, Max takes everything in. The sun is huge, the sky is a bright cobalt blue. A perfect day. Max climbs up onto Carol&rsquo;s shoulders, getting a better lookat the incredible landscape around him.<br>
				<br>
				He notices a group of trees with holes bored in their trunks &mdash; Ira&rsquo;s.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					And on the way I can show you your kingdom. Max, this is all yours. You&rsquo;re the owner of this world. Everything you see is yours. Oh,except that hole right there that&rsquo;s Ira&rsquo;s. But, I mean the tree&rsquo;s yours, but the hole is Ira&rsquo;s. But everything else is yours... except that rock over there, that&rsquo;s not yours, that little rock next to the big rock. But everything else in the kingdom, except for that stick, that little stick right there, that&rsquo;s not yours...
				</p>
				Max realizes Carol&rsquo;s been kidding, and laughs. Carol laughs at how long it took Max to get the joke. They laugh together.
				<p ="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					I want you to be king forever Max.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Yeah, definitely.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<b>EXT. VAST DESERT &ndash; DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				Max and Carol walk side by side amid an endless expanse of fine sand a desert in the middle of the island. Behind them is a foot dune.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					This part of your kingdom is not so good.<br><br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Why?<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					(his anxiety starting to reveal itself)<br>
					Well, look. This used to be all rock, and now it&rsquo;s sand. And then one day it&rsquo;s gonna be dust. And then the whole island will be dust. And then... I don&rsquo;t even know what comes after dust.
				</p>
				Max pauses, something weighing on him.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Carol? Did you know the sun was gonna die?<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					What?<br>
					Carol looks up at the sun for a moment.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					I never heard that.<br>
					(beat)<br>
					Oh come on. That can&rsquo;t happen. You&rsquo;re the king. And look at me. I&rsquo;m big. How could guys like us worry about a tiny little thing like the sun?
				</p>
				Carol looks up at the sun again, wondering.<br>
				<br>
				Just then, a huge, mangy dog at least 30 feet tall lumbers slowly by, far off in the distance. Only Max sees it at first. His jaw drops.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Carol, what&rsquo;s that?<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Oh, it&rsquo;s that dog. Don&rsquo;t feed it, it&rsquo;ll just follow you around.
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<b>EXT. BASE OF SILVERY MOUNTAIN &ndash; DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				Max and Carol are climbing up a steep hillside of oversized silvery rocks. Carol&rsquo;s huge legs make climbing the rocks much easier than for Max. Max struggles to keep up.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Carol, wait up for me!
				</p>
				Max, climbing over a great silver stone, finally sees their destination; Carol&rsquo;s standing in the entrance. It&rsquo;s an intricate wooden structure some kind of Wild Thing home built into the side of the mountain.
				<br><br>
				Up ahead, Carol looks around to make sure no one has followed them, and disappears inside.
				<br><br>
				When Max finally makes it to the door, he hesitates for a moment, then steps inside.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>IN<u>CAROL</u>&rsquo;S WORKSHOP &ndash; DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				The room is large, a studio of some kind. It&rsquo;s messy but full of projects. Max enters and slowly walks around, taking everything in.
				<br><br>
				On the main worktable, an entire city is laid out, almost 20 feet long and six feet tall buildings shaped like mountains and hills in an organized, almost gridlike format. Carol scurries about preparing his creation, anxious about what Max will think.
				<br><br>
				The details are immaculate and painstaking. It looks like it would have taken 10 years to make. It&rsquo;s a model world controllable, predictable, tidy.
				<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				Wow.<br>
				(with awe and respect)<br>
				Did you make this?<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Yeah.<br>
				<br>
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				It&rsquo;s very good.<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Thanks.<br>
				(now seeming to recall some painful memory)<br>
				We were gonna make a whole world like this. Everyone used to come here, but now, well...<br>
				(looks at model)<br>
				Do you know what it feels like when all your teeth are falling out really slowly and you don&rsquo;t even notice and one day you realize they&rsquo;re all separated really far apart and then you don&rsquo;t have any teeth anymore?<br>
				<br>
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				(in a whisper)<br>
				Yeah.<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Well, it&rsquo;s like that.<br>
			</p>
			Carol shakes off the darkening mood. His face brightens.
			<p id="talk">
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Alright, put your head right here. Right here.
			</p>
			Max puts his head up through a hole in the middle of the city now he can see it all from within.
			<br><br>
			As he looks up at the enormous canyon created by blocks and blocks of buildings, we hear the sound of water being poured from a jug.
			<p id="talk">
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Alright, now watch.<br>
			</p>
			We&rsquo;re still with Max&rsquo;s POV of the city in closeup when we see the water slowly flowing through the streets.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>INTERCUT BETWEEN THE WORKSHOP &amp; <u>MAX</u>&rsquo;S POV OF THE MODEL CITY</b>
			<br><br>
			The streets are now paved with water for dozens of blocks. A minicanoe with small carved Wild Things in it slowly glides through an intersection, in and out of view.
			<br><br>
			Closeup on the canoe, which we now see holds tiny, crudely carved facsimiles of Carol and K.W.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				Wow. I wish I could live in there.<br>
			</p>
			On the streets of the mode l city and in the windows of the buildings, Max sees tiny versions of Judith and Ira, Alexander, Douglas and The Bull.
			<p id="talk">
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Yeah, it was gonna be a place where only things you wanted to have happen would happen.<br>
				<br>
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				Yeah.<br>

	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				I guess if that&rsquo;s not going to happen, I&rsquo;ll probably just end up eating my feet off.
			</p>
			Max turns to Carol.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				Carol, we can totally build a place like that.
				Carol looks cautious, but excited.<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Really?<br>
			</p>
			<b>EXT. LAVA FIELD &ndash; AFTERNOON</b>
			<br><br>
			A wide peaceful shot of Carol and Max as they walk back toward the campsite.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				Okay, we&rsquo;re gonna start with a perfect fort. And then we&rsquo;re gonna build a city and an underground complex. But, I mean, you&rsquo;ve gotta be realistic because I mean, the underground complex is gonna tie it all together.<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				(chuckling)<br>
				I like your brain, Max.
			</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<b>EXT. BEACH &ndash; DAY</b>
			<br><br>
			Max, Carol and Douglas are together on the beach.
			<p id="talk">
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				(calling out to the others)<br>
				Hey! I&rsquo;m not gonna eat my feet off anymore.<br>
				<br>
				<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
				Why?<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Max is gonna build a fortress!<br>
			</p>
			Max takes a stick and starts drawing in the sand. The other Wild Things Judith, Ira, Alexander and the Bull all gather around. K.W. wanders up to the group.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				... So it&rsquo;s gonna be as tall as twelve of you and six of me. And only we can get in. We can have an ice cream parlor. A swimming pool with a bottom that&rsquo;s also a trampoline.
			</p>
			The Wild Things are listening carefully, as if this is the most rational plan in the world.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				...And anyone that gets in there that we don&rsquo;t want there will get their brains cut out. The building will do it automatically.
			</p>
			Carol and Douglas nod respectfully.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
				(to Judith)<br>
				How does it know which brains to cut out?
			</p>
			Everyone ignores him, still studying the fort plans.<br>
			<br>
			Max continues.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				Oh, and there&rsquo;ll be a fake tree but it&rsquo;s not a tree, it&rsquo;s a tunnel...
			</p>
			Max is drawing the tree, outside the fort, but the Bull&rsquo;s toe is on the beach, where the tree needs to be.<br>
			<br>
			Max draws half the tree and runs up against the Bull&rsquo;s toe. He looks up to the Bull, but it&rsquo;s clear the Bull isn&rsquo;t going to move. So Max draws around the huge toe, such that the round head of the tree becomes a halfmoon.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				So anyways, it&rsquo;s not a tree, it&rsquo;s a tunnel, and it&rsquo;ll lead you into the fort through a compartment. Ira, do you want to be in charge of the tunnels because you make great holes?<br>
				<br>
				<u>IRA</u><br>
				Wow. Okay.<br>
				<br>
				<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
				I don&rsquo;t want my brains cut out!
			</p>
			Nobody says anything.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>IRA</u><br>
				This fort is already making me happy.<br>
				<br>
				<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
				Does anybody ever hear me?<br>
				<br>
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				And we&rsquo;ll all sleep together in a real pile.<br>
				(beat, looking to the whole group)<br>
				What do you think?<br>
				<br>
				<u>JUDITH</u><br>
				<br>
				I don&rsquo;t really think anything like this ever works, really.<br>
				(with a smidgen of hope)<br>
				But if it did...<br>
				(returning to her usual self)<br>
				I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know anything. But I do like sleeping in a real pile.
			</p>
			A tiny smile takes over Judith&rsquo;s face. She&rsquo;s sold. Alexander sees this and stops crying.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				(to Carol)<br>
				Carol, will you be in charge of building it?<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Oh. Uh...<br>

				<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
				You should definitely be in charge, Carol. You&rsquo;re the only one who could pull it off.<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				(coming around but still unsure)<br>
				Yeah, well... You&rsquo;re right, but...<br>
				<br>
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				K.W., don&rsquo;t you think that Carol should build it?<br>
				<br>
				<u>K.W.</u><br>
				Yeah. He&rsquo;s the only one who can.
			</p>
			Some murmuring of approval. Carol is touched by this gesture of support.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>JUDITH</u><br>
				I&rsquo;ll build it if he doesn&rsquo;t want to.<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				(quietly)<br>
				Wow... do you really want to do this?<br>
				<br>
				<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
				I think it&rsquo;s a perfect idea.<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Well, alright...<br>
				(to everybody)<br>
				if you all want to do it, and you want me, I&rsquo;d be honored.
			</p>
			Max beams. Ira turns to Judith.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>IRA</u><br>
				You would have been good too, Judy.<br>
			</p>
			Judith shrugs.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>JUDITH</u><br>
				Yeah.<br>
			</p>
			<b>EXT. BIG CLEARING/FORT SITE &ndash; MIDMORNING</b>
			<br><br>
			The construction is about to begin. Max brings a bunch of rocks and dumps them in the clearing. Just after him, Ira carries his own gigantic pile and dumps it on top of Max&rsquo;s. They almost crush Max like a grape.
			<br><br>
			Rocks are being thrown from somewhere out of sight, into a great pile. Max loves it. Everyone is working happily, believing in the fort.<br>
			<br>
			Max directs Bull towards the edge of a cliff above him.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				A little more that way. A little more. Yeah right there.<br>
			</p>
			Bull stomps breaking off part of the cliff and sending boulders tumbling below. Max cheers.<br>
			<br>
			Carol pushes two huge trees, roots and all, into the clearing and drops them. They land with a huge and satisfying crash atop a great pile of other trees.<br>
			<br>
			Carol and Douglas are trying to determine the placement of the foundation. Ira stands nearby on a small pile of rocks, being the placemarker. Carol is holding Douglas like a suitcase, using him as a measuring tool.<br>
			Max is standing far away, to get perspective.<br>
			<p id="talk">
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				(yelling across the way to Max)<br>
				How about here? You like it here?<br>
				<br>
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				Yeah. A little more this way. It should be seven Douglases.
			</p>
			Carol picks up Douglas again.
			<p id="talk">
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				(to Douglas)<br>
				What have you been eating?<br>
				<br>
				<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
				(sheepishly)<br>

				Rocks? What did I tell you about eating rocks?<br>
				<br>
				<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
				That&rsquo;s six.<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				You&rsquo;re getting a little paunch.<br>
				<br>
				<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
				Uh, I know.<br>
				(beat)<br>
				Mark it.<br>
			</p>
			K.W. crosses past Max, carrying branches.
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				Hey, K.W..<br>
				<br>
				<u>K.W.</u><br>
				Hey, King.<br>
				Carol moves Douglas one more length.<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				How about here?
				<br>
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				It needs seven Douglas&rsquo;s, no more,
				and no less.<br>
				<br>
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				Seven chubby Douglases.
			</p>
				<br>
			<b>EXT. BIG CLEARING/FORT SITE &ndash; LATER</b>
			<br><br>
			There&rsquo;s activity everywhere. Rocks are being stacked, sticks are being woven, Wild Things are sinking posts into the earth and stomping on them to drive them deeper. Max runs around, directing everyone, on top of the world.
			<br><br>
			<p id="talk">
				<u>MAX</u><br>
				It&rsquo;s gonna be part castle, part fort, part mountain, and part ship. We&rsquo;ll have a laboratory so we can build robots to do stuff for us, our own detective agency, and our own language. And we&rsquo;ll make a machine that can take our legs off and that way we can float.
				Carol and Douglas are carrying huge trees over their shoulders.<br>
			</p>
				Carol watches Judith stacking wood.<br>
			<p id="talk">
	<u>CAROL</u><br>
				You smiled. You can&rsquo;t deny that this was a good idea.<br>
				<br>
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					I didn&rsquo;t deny it.<br>
					(now with a smile)<br>
					I believe part of that idea was mine.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					What part?<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					The part where I said, &ldquo;Yeah. Good idea.&rdquo;
				</p>
				Carol and Judith laugh.<br>
				<br>
				K.W. works quietly off by herself, smashing tree trunks in half and tossing them in a pile.<br>
				<br>
				Ira tosses boulders to Douglas.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Oh!<br>
				</p>	
				Judith licks Alexander&rsquo;s face.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					Judith, that tickles.
				</p>
				Max drops into a tunnel and sees Ira punching holes and digging.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					I like the tunnel, Ira. Impressive.<br>
					<br>
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Oh! Why thank you, King.
				</p>
				Max climbs out of the hole and sees Douglas working on installing the fort&rsquo;s upper beams. Carol walks by in the background.<br>
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Great beams, Douglas. Strong.<br>
					<br>
					<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
					(loving the attention, but awkward, not knowing how to take a compliment)<br>
					Oh, uh thanks. They&rsquo;re just the standard beams I always do.
				</p>
				Carol works on a wall, carving into it. Max takes Carol&rsquo;s hand and carves an &ldquo;M&rdquo; .<br>
				<br>
				Carol draws a heart around it. They hug and both begin to howl.<br>
				<br>
				We cut to Judith, watching Max and Carol intently. She looks concerned.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. HOLE DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				Judith and Ira sit in their hole. Max is off in the distance working.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					(stage whisper)<br>
					Psst!
				</p>
				Max looks up. Judith is gesturing for him to come over.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					What were you doing with Carol just now?<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Just talking.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Oh, a secret, huh? Well let me ask you something. How does it work around here? Are we all the same, or are some of us better than others? You like to play favorites, huh, King?
				</p>
				Ira starts gnawing on Judith&rsquo;s shoulder.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Ow.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					No, I like all you guys equally.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Oh, don&rsquo;t give me that. I can see how it is. The king has favorites, that&rsquo;s really cute.<br>
					(Ira still gnawing on her)<br>
					Ow. Stop.<br>
					(back to Max)<br>
					Do you have a favorite color, too? Can I be your favorite color?
				</p>
				She laughs dismissively, rolling her eyes at him. Max gets mad, but doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. He gives her a fake laugh back. She gives him a louder fake laugh back. And they get into a fake laughoff.<br>
				<br>
				Max&rsquo;s fake laugh is nastiest, though, and she rears back, hurt.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					(close to tears)<br>
					You know what? You can&rsquo;t do that back to me. If we&rsquo;re upset, your job is not to get upset back at us. Our job is to be upset. If I get mad and wanna eat you, then you have to say, &ldquo;Oh okay, you can eat me, I love you, whatever makes you happy, Judith.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re supposed to do.
				</p>
				Max doesn&rsquo;t know what to say. K.W. comes to the rescue.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Come on Max. Let&rsquo;s go get those sticks.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Yeah... okay.<br>
					Max turns to leave with K.W. Judith grabs his leg.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					I hope you heard me, King.
				</p>
				Max tries to pull his leg away. K.W. steps on Judith&rsquo;s wrist, freeing Max.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Ow!<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Yeah, he heard you, Judith. Everyone always hears you.

				<p id="talk">

					(yelling after them)<br>
					You think you have power, K.W.?
					That&rsquo;s not real power.<br>

				</p>
				Max turns his head.
				<p id="talk">

					No! Not you! I&rsquo;m still talking to K.W.!
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<b>EXT. DUNE &ndash; AFTERNOON</b>
				<br><br>
				Max and K.W. walk to the top of a dune. Below a wide white sand beach spreads out, the bright blue ocean beyond. The shore is scattered with giant trees.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Okay, Judith can be a downer. You just need help figuring this out.<br>
					(beat)<br>
					Hey, you should talk to Bob and Terry.<br>
					(beat)<br>
					King!
				</p>
				They continue to walk.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Seriously, they&rsquo;re really smart. They have the answers to everything.
				</p>
				Max looks up and K.W. is smiling mischievously. She shoves him down the sand dune, then she dives down behind him. They tumble down together, head over heels.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. SAND DUNES &ndash; BY OCEAN</b>
				Max gets up and tries to tackle her, but stops. She&rsquo;s laughing. They hear a sound and look up.<br>
				<br>
				Two owls fly overhead.<br>
				<br>
				Max watches them soar like kites, and then, as if hit by a missile, one drops from the sky and onto the beach. Max looks up to the second owl, who falls the same way.<br>
				<br>
				Max sees that it was KW who brought them down, with rocks she&rsquo;s thrown.<br>
				<br>
				He&rsquo;s so confused.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					(running toward the owls)<br>
					Hang on, I&rsquo;m coming!
				</p>
				K.W. runs off, and returns with one owl each the size of a beagle under each arm. They look a little disoriented, but they&rsquo;re clearly comfortable with K.W.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Well, what do you think?<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Umm...<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					<br>
					This is Bob &amp; Terry. They love it when I do this to them. Bob, Terry, this is Max, he&rsquo;s the biter I told you about.

				The owls squeak.
				<p id="talk">

					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(unsure)<br>
					Hi.<br>
					<br>

					(to the owls)<br>
					He wanted to ask you guys some advice.

					Go ahead, they&rsquo;re not judgmental.<br>
					<br>

					Yeah.<br>

					How. Do. I. Make. Everyone.<br>

				They squeak again. Bob then Terry.
				<p id="talk">

					Oh, yeah. I didn&rsquo;t think of that.

				They squeak again. Terry then Bob. K.W. turns to Max.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Wow, they really get to the heart of it, don&rsquo;t they?
				</p>
				Max hasn&rsquo;t understood anything the owls have said. He decides not to tell K.W.
				<p id="talk">

					Aren&rsquo;t they great?<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Uh...<br>

				Max thinks for a moment.
				<p id="talk">

				<b>EXT. FORT &ndash; DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				K.W. and Max return to the fort carrying Bob and Terry. They see that the fort is now more or less complete. It&rsquo;s gigantic 200 feet high and thrilling in its detail. Max, happy beyond words, runs to the fort.
				<p id="talk">

		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					I thought you said if anybody got in here we didn&rsquo;t want, the fort would automatically cut their brains out.

					Oh, well... I thought that then, but I kinda decided that that isn&rsquo;t really right and that it should kinda not be like that. If we know them, then they should keep their brains.<br>

					<br>
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Judy, I&rsquo;m with you.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Yeah, I heard.

				Ira joins the bad guys.
				<p id="talk">

					And you can pick one other.<br>

					He&rsquo;s with you. He&rsquo;s on your team.<br>
					<br>

					(to Carol)<br>
					So am I a good guy?<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Yes, of course, you have the best arm.

				K.W. emerges from the forest.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Hey, where were you?<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Saying goodbye to Bob and Terry.<br>
					<br>

					Hey K.W., you wanna be on my team? We&rsquo;re the bad guys.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(excited)<br>
					No, nono, no. You&rsquo;re with us. You&rsquo;re a good guy.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					(meekly)<br>
					Yeah, K.W., be a good guy.
				</p>
				Max walks K.W. over next to Carol, trying to reconcile them.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Hi, K.W.
				</p>
				K.W. just looks at him. She starts to soften, even smiles. Max watches, happy and relieved. So far the war has brought everyone together!
				<br><br>
				Douglas walks over to them to join the team.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Okay. So what we are gonna do is we&rsquo;re gonna try to kill the bad guys by beaning them in the head with these dirt clods. We&rsquo;re gonna try to find the biggest pieces...
				</p>
				BAM! Max is suddenly smacked in the back of his head by a dirt clod. He turns to see Alexander laughing. He threw the first one, and is getting another clod ready.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					You didn&rsquo;t see that coming!
				</p>
				The war is on.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Run!<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Run for cover!<br>
					<br>
					<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
					Wait, hold on! We didn&rsquo;t make the official starting noise!
				</p>
				Max and his team run away.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Yeah. You&rsquo;d better run.<br>
					<br>
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					Bad guys rule!<br>
					<br>
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Look out for the bad guys!<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					We&rsquo;re coming to get you, favorites! Die!
				</p>
				Max runs across the field and into the forest, his team in tow. The dirt clods explode everywhere.
				<br><br>
				Max and Douglas slide into a gully, exchanging fire with Judith and Ira across the way.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					Yes! Direct hit.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Good shot, Ira!
				</p>
				K.W. comes sliding over the berm, into the gully shared by Max and Douglas. Carol runs over to where they are.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(loudly, adopting a military tenor)<br>
					We need to find higher ground! Move out!
				</p>
				Max&rsquo;s team makes a break for it. Carol&rsquo;s first, Max a few feet behind, then Douglas and K.W. further back. Explosions all around, as the good guys huff and puff.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. CLEARING NEAR A CLIFF &ndash; CONTINUOUS</b>
				<br><br>
				Judith and Ira are surrounded, hiding behind a large rock. Max, Douglas and Carol are lying in wait, perched on a hill above them, about fifty feet away.<br>
				<br>
				Every time Judith or Ira tries to peek out from their rock, Max&rsquo;s team pummels them.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					We got them pinned down! They can&rsquo;t even move!<br>
					<br>

					Okay!<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					One, two, three!<br>
					<br>

					You guys are gonna... Ow!
				</p>
				Max, Carol and Douglas throw dirt clods at Judith and Ira.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					(from behind the rock, laughing)<br>
					Ahhh! Stop! Stop, stop it.<br>
					<br>
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					(from behind rock)<br>
					Judy, I&rsquo;m trapped.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(to his team)<br>
					This is perfect! They throw more dirt clods. We hear Judith and Ira behind the log.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Ohh, wow!<br>
					<br>
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Let them waste their ammunition.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					They&rsquo;re not going to run out of dirt. Whoa! That was hard. It&rsquo;s just a game! Let us out of here.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(to Carol and Douglas)<br>
					Wait, wait. I have an idea. Come out!<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					No!<br><br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Why not?<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Ahh, because you&rsquo;re gonna hit us in the head with dirt.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Come out!<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Nooo!<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Why not?<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Because when I said you&rsquo;re gonna hit us in the head with dirt, you didn&rsquo;t say anything. <i>That means you&rsquo;re planning to hit us in the head with dirt.</i><br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(to Carol and Douglas)<br>
					Man, they really have us figured out.
				</p>
				Max thinks.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Okay, let&rsquo;s go! Ambush!
				</p>
				Max, Carol and Douglas run toward where Judith and Ira are hiding.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Charge!
				</p>
				Judith runs away.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Ira, help! Get Carol.<br>
					<br>
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Ooh, good shot. I&rsquo;m gonna get you!
				</p>
				A huge mound hits the tree trunk behind them and falls to the ground. When it lands, we see that it&rsquo;s actually a raccoon, which gets up and begins to scurry off. Carol grabs it and hurls it back at the bad guys. The raccoon hits Ira in the head and bites his nose.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Hey, who threw Richard? He&rsquo;s on our team now.<br>
					<br>
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Ahhh! Owwww!<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Gotcha!<br>
					<br>
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Owww. No animals! Owww! It really hurts.
				</p>
				Max peers up, and sees Alexander skulking on an open ridge. Alexander is oblivious, thinking the front is in another direction entirely.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Hey Douglas, get the goat. Knock his legs out!
				</p>
				Douglas unleashes a devastating dirt clod, which knocks Alexander flat. It&rsquo;s comical but painful. Alexander gets up with tears
					in his eyes.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					Owww!<br>
					(finding Douglas and Max and yelling to them)<br>
					That&rsquo;s cheating. I&rsquo;m not gonna play anymore.
					<br><br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(whispering to Douglas)<br>
					Do it again.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Alexander come on! Fight with us!
				</p>
				Douglas does, and this time hits Alexander&rsquo;s back a huge cloud of dust. Max smiles mischievously, as if to say &ldquo;Oops!&rdquo; He&rsquo;s having a great time.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					Owww! That&rsquo;s not fair! Are you crazy?!<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Alexander you&rsquo;re supposed to get hit, it&rsquo;s a war.<br>
					<br>
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					That wasn&rsquo;t fair. Douglas hit me when I was hurt. You can&rsquo;t hit someone when they&rsquo;re hurt. I quit.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Get back in here right now.<br>
					<br>
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Alex, count to ten. Things will get better.<br><br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Alexander, don&rsquo;t you cry!<br>
					<br>
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					If I count to ten will you be gone Ira?
				</p>
				Alexander stalks off.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Don&rsquo;t you talk to Ira the way I do.
				</p>
				Max throws a dirt clod at Judith, nailing her in the head.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Knock it off, Judith!<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Owww! That&rsquo;s my eye!
				</p>
				Carol and K.W. laugh and exchange looks.<br>
				<br>
				Max ducks, giggling.<br>
				<br>
				Max, Carol and the team run.<br>
				<br>
				Down the path, Carol falls. Max dives over him, bodyslamming his stomach playfully. Carol laughs, Max laughs. Once on the other side of Carol&rsquo;s mass of flesh, Max uses him as a wall.<br>
				<br>
				Now Douglas approaches, but can&rsquo;t slow down in time to avoid Carol&rsquo;s prone figure.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
					Whoa!
				</p>
				He tries to jump over Carol and Max, but his foot lands on Carol&rsquo;s head. It&rsquo;s awkward and painful, but also sort of comic.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Ow!
				</p>
				Landing, Douglas looks worried.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
					Carol, I&rsquo;m so sorry!
				</p>
				Carol laughs. Douglas is relieved.<br>
				<br>
				Now K.W., coming down the path running fast, has seen this fun, and, overexcited, she runs at full speed and jumps off Carol&rsquo;s head, landing on Douglas&rsquo; face. Instantly Carol leaps up and is no longer laughing. He&rsquo;s fuming.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					(laughing)<br>
					What happened? Somebody stepped on your head?<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					(outraged)<br>
					What are you doing?<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					(laughing)<br>
					What?<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Don&rsquo;t step on my head!<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					(innocently &ndash; she didn&rsquo;t mean it)<br>
					What do you mean? It&rsquo;s a war! And Douglas just did it.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Yeah but he did it by accident. You did it on purpose! And he didn&rsquo;t step on the face part of my head!<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					It was a joke. I was just joking.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Yeah, sure you were, like you aren&rsquo;t always looking for an opportunity to step on my head. That&rsquo;s what you do.
				</p>
				Max watches the argument, standing below them, looking from one and then the other.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					This is exactly why I never want to do anything with you anymore.<br>
					(she lays down)<br>
					Go ahead and step on my head.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					No. Forget it. I&rsquo;m not going to step on your head just to make you feel better.
				</p>
				Carol leaves, running up the hill.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Come on, Douglas!<br>
					<br>
					<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
					(judiciously)<br>
					Carol, I think that you did the right thing, you know, not stepping on her head.
				</p>
				Close on Max as we hear this, and Judith and Ira complaining about their injuries off in the distance.<br>
				<br>
				Max approaches K.W. as she lies on the ground. Max steps on K.W.&rsquo;s head, as she lies there. K.W., still upset, smiles weakly.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Thanks, Max. But I&rsquo;m done.<br>
					I don&rsquo;t know why I came back. I&rsquo;m glad I met you, I guess.
				</p>
				Max looks sad and worried.<br>
				<br><br>
				<b>EXT. AROUND THE CAMPFIRE &ndash; NIGHT, LATER</b>
				<br><br>
				Max and all of the Wild Things are sitting around the fire. We pan around the fire, from one Wild Thing to the next. Each is filthy covered in burrs and dirt. Their injuries are visible, their anger unmasked. They blame him for all the misery brought on by the war.<br>
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					(anxious)<br>
					So King. This is how you rule a kingdom? Everyone fighting? The bad guys feel bad. Everyone feels bad!<br>
					<br>
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Yeah. I&rsquo;m still sorta dizzy and my eyeballs feel loose.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					Oh can it, Ira. Everyone&rsquo;s eyeballs feel loose.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					No, Max will bring K.W. back. He&rsquo;ll keep us all together. He has powers. Right? Show us. C&rsquo;mon King.
				</p>
				Max is put on the spot. Everyone waits expectantly. He doesn&rsquo;t know what to do, so he falls back on an old standard. Finally, instead of speaking, he does the robot dance that he last did with his mom.<br>
				<br>
				Everyone looks dumbfounded.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					Uh oh, somebody broke the king.<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					I don&rsquo;t get it. Oh wait, I do. It&rsquo;s stupid.
				</p>
				Max stops dancing.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>IRA</u><br>
					I think he&rsquo;s done now. What just happened, Judy?<br>
					<br>
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					That&rsquo;s what we waited for?<br>
					<br>
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					Pathetic.
				</p>
				Judith turns and walks away.
				<br><br>
				All of the Wild Things slowly get up. At that moment, a snowflake appears. Then more the flakes come down slowly, waywardly. The Wild Things watch and sigh with resignation.
				<br><br>
				Judith, Alexander and Ira walk off. Carol waits for all of the Wild Things to leave.
				<br><br>
				Carol walks away, pausing only to shake his head, profoundly disappointed in Max. He disappears into the forest.
				<br><br>
				For a moment, Max isn&rsquo;t sure whether he should be leaving with Carol. All alone, Max looks around, seeing only emptiness in every direction. The snow increases.<br>
				<br>
				He stares out into darkness.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(calling out, scared)<br>
					Carol?<br>
				</p>
				No response. He sits next to a tree and thinks about what to do.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. CAMPSITE &ndash; NEXT MORNING</b>
				<br><br>
				Max walks through the forest and out to the edge of the cliff. He stares out at the water, thoughtfully.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>INT. FORT &ndash; THAT NIGHT</b>
				<br>
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Hi.
				</p>
				Finally Max sits down next to Alexander, tentatively, apologetically.<br>
				<br>
				Neither of them speak for a moment. Max sees a wound on Alexander&rsquo;s back. The conversation is in a soft whisper so as not to wake anyone.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Is that from the dirt clods?<br>
					<br>
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					Yeah, from when you had Douglas hit me.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Sorry about that.<br>
					<br>
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					It&rsquo;s okay.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(sympathetically)<br>
					No one really listens to you, huh?<br>
					<br>
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					Oh, you noticed?<br>
					(beat)<br>
					Yeah. I guess you&rsquo;re not used to that... being a king and all.
				</p>
				Max, still heavyhearted, smiles at him.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Man, I really messed this place up.
				</p>
				Alexander studies Max.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					You&rsquo;re not really a king, huh? You&rsquo;re just regular.
				</p>
				Max looks at Alexander, guilty.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					(disappointed)<br>
					I knew it.<br>
					(then back to Max, seriously)<br>
					I don&rsquo;t even know if there is such a thing as a king that can do all the things you said.

				Max says nothing.
				<p id="talk">

					Look, I don&rsquo;t care, just don&rsquo;t ever let Carol find out.

				<b>INT. FORT &ndash; NIGHT</b>
				<br><br>
				All the Wild Things are sleeping. Max is awake, and he watches Carol. Carol is scratching the ground, anxious and restless. It scares Max.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>INT. FORT SITE &ndash; MORNING</b>
				<br><br>
				The sky is overcast. Max is inside the fort, pacing out dimensions, drawing an outline of something on the wall. Carol approaches.
				<br><br>
				Carol walks up and notices Max&rsquo;s markings on the wall.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Hey, Max. What&rsquo;s that?<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Um... Well, I was thinking we needed a place where the king is secret. Like a secret chamber for the king.
				</p>
				Carol looks at the fort, tilting his head.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Well, I don&rsquo;t understand... What...<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Well, you know like a... like a small place. With a door that&rsquo;s not so big.
				</p>
				When Carol begins to understand the implications here, his feelings get bruised.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					(pondering)<br>
					I don&rsquo;t know...<br>
					(studying the fort)<br>
					I just didn&rsquo;t picture it with secret doors.<br>
					(pause as he collects his thoughts and thinks of a way out of this)<br>
					What if it were a big place with big secret doors?<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					That... that&rsquo;s not really how it would be done. It&rsquo;s more like... it&rsquo;s like a... it&rsquo;s like a...
				</p>
				This is getting frustrating for Carol. He tries to control his rage, but can&rsquo;t.<br>
				<br>
				Without warning and with a great crash, he punches a hole in the wall.<br>
				<br>
				Max looks surprised.<br>
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					(embarrassed)<br>
					About that big?

				Carol turns and walks off, visibly hurt.

				<b>INT. FORT &ndash; PREDAWN</b>
				<br><br>
				Everyone is sleeping in the fort.
				Max is laying inside the area reserved for his secret chamber. It&rsquo;s not built yet just an outline in the floor.<br>

				Max startles awake. Carol&rsquo;s voice booms out of the darkness.

				</p>
				Suddenly Carol rips off Douglas&rsquo; arm. Douglas stands, staring at him with sand pouring out of his shoulder.

					<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
					Oww!!<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Stop it! What are you doing?!<br>
				</p>
				Carol throws Douglas&rsquo; arm. The rest of the Wild Things are shocked. But it becomes clear that this kind of thing isn&rsquo;t unprecedented.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
					Carol.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					What?<br>
					<br>
					<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
					That was my favorite arm.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Well, I was just holding on to it. You pulled away.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Carol, stop it!<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					You lied!<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					You&rsquo;re out of control!
				</p>
				This hits Carol hard. He&rsquo;s lost in confusion and rage.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					I am not out of control! You were supposed to take care of us! You promised!<br>
					(big roar)<br>
					I&rsquo;ll eat you up!
				</p>
				He lunges for Max.<br>
				<br>
				Max bolts. Carol chases him into the woods.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. FOREST &ndash; CONTINUOUS</b>
				<br><br>
				Carol is crying hysterically as he chases Max toward the forest, both of them at full speed. Max darts through a low, small opening in the dense forest too small for Carol to fit through. Carol crashes head first into the trees.<br>
				<br>
				The forest is too dense. Carol grinds to a halt, stuck in the trees. Max ploughs on, rushing through the dense woods. Carol watches him escape.<br>
				<br>
				Max continues through the woods. He breaks through the foliage onto a forest path.<br>
				<br>
				Max runs down the path. The sound of Carol yelling echoes in the distance. Max is looking back, trying to see where Carol is, and runs full&ndash;speed into K.W.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					C&rsquo;mon, C&rsquo;mon. C&rsquo;mere.<br>
				</p>
				K.W. has a look of desperation on her face, and Max spends a split second trying to read it. Carol is getting closer.<br>
				<br>
				She grabs his arm and yanks him off the path.<br><br>
				Carol runs by, growling ferociously. He&rsquo;s terrifying now, without any trace of the more civilized or charming Carol. Now he&rsquo;s pure id, a raging animal.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Get in, get inside!<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					What?
				</p>
				K.W. has her mouth open, and is indicating that Max should crawl into her.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Get in. Crawl inside my mouth. I&rsquo;ll hide you!
				</p>
				The growling of Carol gets louder. Max realizes that he has no choice. He starts, tentatively, to crawl into K.W.&rsquo;s mouth. Once he&rsquo;s half&ndash;way in, she swallows him whole.<br>
				<br>
				Max lands inside of KW, where there are some rocks and sticks and &ldquo;Richard&rdquo; the raccoon. Richard is hanging out, eating some twigs. He and Max make eye contact.<br>
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Oh, hi Richard.
				</p><br>
				<b>INTERCUT BETWEEN INSIDE K.W AND FOREST</b>
				<br>
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Max! Max!<br>
				</p>
				Carol bursts into the area near K.W. We&rsquo;re close on Max inside of K.W. He&rsquo;s barely lit by the dim light coming from above. He tries to breathe quietly.<br>
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Where is he!?<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					(defiantly)<br>
					I don&rsquo;t know!<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Where is he?<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					I don&rsquo;t know!<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					I can smell him! Where is he?!<br>
					(beat)<br>
					I just want to talk to him.<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					You&rsquo;re out of control!<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					I&rsquo;m not out of control!<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					You were going to eat him!<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					(deflated)<br>
					No, no... I wa I wasn&rsquo;t going to... I don&rsquo;t know...I just said it.<br>
					(tortured)<br>
					Am I as bad as he says I am?
				</p>
				Close on Max. He starts to soften.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Just go away!<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					I just wanted us all to be together...
				</p>
				He turns, defeated, and walks off.<br>
				<br>
				Close on Max. He feels for Carol.
				<br><br>
				K.W., breathing hard, walks into a small, dark clearing, covered with fallen trees and pools of liquid.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					(repeating Carol)<br>
					Can you believe him?<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					He doesn&rsquo;t mean to be that way, K.W. He&rsquo;s just scared.<br>
					<br>
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					(softening somewhat)<br>
					Well, he only makes it harder. And it&rsquo;s hard enough already.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(thinking about his own behavior)<br>
					I know.<br>
					(beat)<br>
					But he loves you. You&rsquo;re his family.
				</p>
				K.W. thinks about this for a minute.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Yeah... I guess.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					I can&rsquo;t breathe that well in here. Can you get me out?
				</p>
				Close on Max. Finally a big hand reaches in and retrieves Max, taking him toward the light. K.W. tilts her head back and draws him out of her throat. After he&rsquo;s been extracted, they sit together, exhausted.
				<br><br>
				Max looks up at her, seeing how hard it is for her. Then he looks down, contemplating this, a new thought enters his head.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					I wish you guys had a mom.
				</p>
				K.W. says nothing, seeming to acknowledge the truth in this.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					I&rsquo;m gonna go home.
				</p><br>
				<b>EXT. DESERT &ndash; DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				The sun rises on the desert.<br>
				<br>
				Max is running where he and Carol had first walked. He&rsquo; full of energy, knowing he&rsquo;s about to leave, that soon he&rsquo;ll be home again.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EX<u>CAROL</u>&rsquo;S STUDIO &ndash; DAY (CONTINUOUS)</b>
				<br><br>
				Max, out of breath, reaches the door
				and enters.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Carol!
				</p><br>
				<b>IN<u>CAROL</u>&rsquo;S STUDIO &ndash; DAY (CONTINUOUS)</b>
				<br><br>
				Inside, the entire mini&ndash;city has been ravaged. There are remnants of it splayed out, glass and metal everywhere, as if Carol had destroyed it in a rage. Max walks around, horrified by the destruction.<br>
				<br>
				On the floor, amid the wreckage, Max sits and begins to work. He takes pieces of the debris and splinters of wood, and begins to arrange something on the floor, though we don&rsquo;t see what exactly it is.<br>
				<br><br>
				<b>EXT. CLIFF ABOVE FORT</b>
				<br><br>
				Max runs toward the fort. As he approaches, he looks over and sees Carol and Douglas sitting together. Douglas stands, excusing himself, so that Max and Carol can talk.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>DOUGLAS</u><br>
					(nodding to Max)<br>
					Max.
				</p>
				Douglas walks off, patting Carol on the back affectionately as he goes.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					(as if this question might answer it all)<br>
					So whatever happened with you and the Vikings?<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					(sweetly and apologetically)<br>
					Well... in the end, I had to leave.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Why?
				</p>
				Carol, upset and hurt, looks up at the fort.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					But I&rsquo;m not a Viking or a king or anything.<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					No, no you&rsquo;re not.<br>
					(beat)<br>
					What are you?<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					I&rsquo;m Max.<br>
					<br>
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					Oh.<br>
					(he stands)<br>
					Well, that&rsquo;s not very much.
				</p>
				Carol thinks about this for a beat, then stands up and walks off.<br>
				<br>
				Max looks after him sadly.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. BEACH &ndash; DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				Max and K.W. see the ocean in front of them. The Wild Things standing awkwardly, silently, around Max&rsquo;s boat.<br>
				<br>
				K.W. and Max approach all of the Wild Things &ndash; Judith, Ira, Douglas, the Bull.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>BULL</u><br>
					Hey Max?
				</p>
				Max is momentarily surprised that finally the Bull has spoken.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Yeah?<br>
					<br>
					<u>BULL</u><br>
					When you go home will you say good things about us?<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Yeah, I will.<br>
					<br>
					<u>BULL</u><br>
					Thanks.
				</p>
				Alexander stands between Judith and Ira, like a toddler leaning against the legs of a parent. Douglas is visibly sad, looking down at Max. He doesn&rsquo;t know what to do.<br>
				<br>
				Max crosses to Ira, and Judith.<br>
				<br>
				Max hugs Ira.<br>
				<br>
				Max looks at Judith.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					You&rsquo;re the first king we haven&rsquo;t eaten.<br>
					<br>
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					Yeah, it&rsquo;s true.
				</p>
				Ira pats Max on the head.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>JUDITH</u><br>
					(interrupting the sentimental moment)<br>
					See ya.
				</p>
				Max nods and crosses to Alexander.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>ALEXANDER</u><br>
					Bye, Max.<br>
					<br>
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Bye.
				</p>
				As Max walks away, we see the hardness on Judith&rsquo;s face drops. She grabs Alexander and hugs him tightly. Max sees Douglas standing beside his boat, holding it steady in the shallow water.<br>
				<br><br>
				<b>IN<u>CAROL</u>&rsquo;S STUDIO &ndash; DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				Carol storms into the workshop, still upset. Carol stops short, noticing Max&rsquo;s gift on the floor below him. His rage quickly dissipates as he sees a heart made of the debris from the studio, a heart much like that which Carol made for Max earlier.<br>
				<br>
				Inside the heart is the letter C.<br>
				<br>
				Carol takes it all in, and sits down before it. He traces the outline of the heart with his claw. He&rsquo;s utterly overcome. He begins to weep.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. DESERT &ndash; DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				Carol is running through the desert. He&rsquo;s running as fast as he can toward the beach.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. BEACH &ndash; DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				They begin pushing the boat into the water.
				Standing in the water, K.W. lifts Max into the boat. As he stands on the bow, they embrace.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>K.W.</u><br>
					Don&rsquo;t go. I&rsquo;ll eat you up, I love you so.
				</p>
				Max hugs her goodbye and is now ready to sail off.<br>
				<br>
				As they&rsquo;re pushing the boat into the water, we hear a great rustling through the forest. They all look up.<br>
				<br>
				Carol comes running from the forest onto the beach, but slows down as soon as he and Max lock eyes.<br>
				<br>
				Max looks at him warily. Carol, respecting this, stops at a distance from Max. Carol looks down, standing as if his hands were in his pockets, wanting to say something, but not knowing what.<br>
				<br>
				Max begins to drift into the ocean. Max and Carol look at each other as Max continues to float away.<br>
				<br>
				Carol walks toward the boat, across the beach, wanting desperately to do or say something, eventually walking past the other Wild Things and wading waist&ndash;deep into the ocean. Max watches, conflicted. Their eyes have been locked the entire time.<br>
				<br>
				Carol looks so sorry but doesn&rsquo;t know what he can possibly say. Max, watching Carol &ndash; who is now up to his chest in the ocean &ndash; emits a sad mournful gentle howl.
				<p id="talk">
					<u>MAX</u><br>
					Aroooooo!
				</p>
				We can almost hear Max&rsquo;s voice cracking. Carol&rsquo;s spirits lift &ndash; he sees this as a small sign of Max&rsquo;s forgiveness.
				<p id="talk">
		<u>CAROL</u><br>
					(mournful in return)<br>
					Arooooooo!
				</p>
				There are a few moments when Max and Carol&rsquo;s howls overlap as Max drifts into the sea. Finally the other Wild Things join in, all howling sorrowfully, in concert, to their departing friend. K.W. howls goodbye, too.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. OCEAN &ndash; NIGHT</b>
				<br><br>
				Max sails alone, under a full moon, with no land in front of him or behind him.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. OCEAN &ndash; DAY</b>
				<br><br>
				Max continues sailing, determined.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. OCEAN &ndash; NIGHT</b>
				<br><br>
				Max finally sees the forest along the horizon, the point from which he came.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. LAKE &ndash; NIGHT</b>
				<br><br>
				Max docks the boat again in the same inlet of the lake. He runs, as fast as he can, through the forest. He&rsquo;s so close to home.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. FOREST &ndash; NIGHT</b>
				<br><br>
				He runs through the forest and then through the neighborhood.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD &ndash; NIGHT</b>
				<br><br>
				A random dog runs up next to him and Max barks at it wildly gleeful as they run side by side. The dog, after running next to him for a moment, splits off.<br>
				<br>
				All of the houses are dark, except for Max&rsquo;s own, in the distance, where some of the lights are still on. He runs toward it until he gets a few houses away, when he slows down to a jog, then a walk.<br>
				<br>
				His last few steps are slow and tentative. He moves to the front door, and we see a close&ndash;up of the doorknob turning.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>INT. <u>MAX</u>&rsquo;S HOUSE &ndash; NIGHT</b>
				<br><br>
				Max tiptoes through the house, nervous of the repercussions. His mom sees him, runs to him, grabs him and holds him. They look at each other. Max is overwhelmed with emotion, feeling both sorry, relieved and grateful that she&rsquo;s taken him back.<br>
				<br>
				She looks at him sweetly, removes his wolf hood, and holds him tighter.
				<br><br><br>
				<b>INT. DINING ROOM &ndash; NIGHT</b>
				<br><br>
				Max is eating his soup. His mom is sitting at the table, too, head resting in her hand, utterly exhausted. She looks affectionately at Max. Max starts to eat his cake, and looks up at his mom. She has fallen asleep. Max tilts his head, studying her, appreciating her, marveling at her.
