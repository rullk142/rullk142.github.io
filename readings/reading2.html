What is Interaction?<br>
<br><br>
This reading is about interaction design and the many ways it can take place. Prior to reading this article, I had no idea there were so many types of systems that interaction design could take place in. I had always thought it was all very simple. Just a relationship between a thing and its user.

Loops were a familiar concept to me, but again, I had not realized there could be so many kinds of loops. This is a helpful article to understand what kind of system we are designing for. It's important to understand the context of the relationship between the interactor and the interaction to better design for it.

An interesting section of the article was when it said that search engines like Google still does not make it a "learning system". It was interesting that we learn from the computer system, but it does not learn from us and that even though it seems like it, by recording our actions, it still isn't consciouly making new decisions based on what its learned from interacting with us in a way that two humans interact with each other. So what about artificial intelligence? Or video games? How now game developers are trying to make it so that the game "listens" to you. I just think that's an interesting point of view for a designer, having that as a goal.
