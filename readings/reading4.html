How Reporting and Moderation On Social Media is Failing Marginalized Groups<br>
<br><br>
It's crazy how present racism is in so many various kinds of platforms. I don't just mean social media, but other areas like evironmentally, educationally, financially, and so forth.<br>
<br>
Why does is feel like privileged people are more visible, when most of the people around me/close to me are marginalized? I come from a very low - middle class area. A place where gangs bring tragedy, events that never reach the mainstream media. In high school, the minority was White people. Articles like this, that remind me of the injustices on marginalized people are heartbreaking.<br>
<br>
And what is this part about outsourced workers who don't even understand completely the complaints they comb through? That makes zero sense to me. Not only does it simply not work and that they are often mistreated, it also takes jobs away from people in America. Outsourcing workers is one of the causes this generation finds it so difficult to find employment.<br>
<br>
Something else about social media that causes divide among America is that 'unconscious bias'. I remember hearing stories during the election of people being completely and utterly shocked that Trump won, because their social media seemed to be telling otherwise. Algorithmic design has many flaws, and it is an area of design that we need to critically approach and question constantly. It's shaping our futures and our viewpoints, and can shift an entire societal perspective. It needs to be more accessible to the public in terms of understanding it.<br>

"The simple solution is adding diversity to staff." I don't think I completely agree with this. Many major corporations like to add diversity to their staff just for the statistics, but it won't make a real difference unless their voices are heard, their ideas seriously considered, and ultimately put into action if beneficial not for the company but for the greater good.<br>
<br>
"Although thereâ€™s nothing that can be done about the sheer numbers of majority-White users on platforms..." - I believe the reason for this is because This is actually NOT for everyone, Tim Berner. Internet access has not reached everyone. Smartphones are not in everyone's hands and computers are not on everyone's desk. Especially for people who cannot afford it.<br>
