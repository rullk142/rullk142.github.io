<p>I liked the point when Sina Bahram was talking about Maya Angelou’s quote, “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” It’s true in the real world, but true as well in the digital. I think that often times, it’s more real in the realm of subconsciousness. It’s the subtle details of a website that create a user’s experience with it. Such as the color changes when a link is clicked, the hover features, the expected standardizations of the web, and so forth.<br><br>
As designers, it is easy to neglect these features and put it on the back burners of our main design. However, these things are the backbone and keep the webpage familiar, almost humble. It keeps the user in mind.

I actually take notes for a legally blind student, so I can see first hand the challenges that they face in everyday life, especially with technology. This particular topic has a place in my heart, and I would like to push my design thinking towards being mroe inclusive of universal/accessible design.
